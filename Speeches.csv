It was a very thrilling thing to see stars like Betty Hutton and Gloria Grahame, Cornel Wilde and Jimmy Stewart, and Chuck Heston – those people risked their lives, as did the thousands of others who were in the circus – and the audiences all through the trip.  I thank you for all of them because I am only one little link in a chain that produced that picture.  And I'm very happy for them.  Thank you."," Cecil B.

 Best Motion Picture, Ben-Hur,"I believe my husband would have said to you that ""Ben-Hur"" is the sum of the work and talent of many people and that he would accept this award with gratitude for all of them.

This award, of course, belongs to the entire team: the technicians, and the actors, the extras, the wonderful people on the back lot, and the wonderful Mirisches in the front office.

I'm talking about those who created the original wonderful stage show: Jerry Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, Steve Sondheim and Arthur Laurents.

Then to George Cukor, the director. His able associates and assistants, Cecil Beaton, Gene Allen, George Hopkins –  I could name them for on and on but time is of the essence and I don't want to be cut off here I don't think. But I want to thank you very, very much, ladies and gentlemen, for presenting this for ""My Fair Lady.""

Let me do this quickly in two parts, because I know it's past midnight in New York and some of my relatives want to go to sleep.There are a number of people I would like to thank, as everyone else would, because they deserve it.  Bob Evans, for giving more than any studio head should in time and creativity.  Frank Yablans, for having the courage and imagination to sell this film and make my mother rich.  Charlie Bluhdorn, for having the courage to finance films, which I guess borders on insanity.  And Peter Bart, who was a friend all the way through.Now last off, there's millions of people who sit out there and people who love film and want to make film that will look at this [holding up the Oscar] and wonder what it's all about.  America needs the motion picture business and the motion picture business needs the United States.  Good audiences need good films as good films need good audiences.  The American dream and what we all want, for me at least, is represented by this [holding up the Oscar].  It's there for everybody if we want to work, dream and try to get it.

 Best Picture, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,"The dream started at the Rialto Theater in Passaic, New Jersey, a long time ago, but now gratification comes from all over the world.  In Japan a reporter said, ""You must have had a grand passion to make this picture.""  And in France a director said, ""You must be fiercely proud.""  And they were both right. What is gratifying right now is to know that you share our pride and our passion with us.  Thank yous must go to a magnificent cast and crew.  To Kirk Douglas, who lived with it for fourteen years.

 Best Picture, Annie Hall,"About seven months ago Lloyd Leipzig of United Artists suggested I start preparing for this, and this afternoon I told Woody that if it happened I would try to be a little dignified.  And he said I'd probably win an acting award if I could do it.  Well, the truth is I'm not very prepared and I don't feel very dignified.  But I want to say just a couple of things about how a filmmaker like Woody evolves.  About seven years ago, David Picker brought us into United Artists with the simple words: Woody, do your thing.  And through the years we have gotten nothing but support, encouragement, help and love from Eric Pleskow, Arthur Krim, Gabe Sumner and Danny Rissner.  They've allowed Woody to mature into a fine filmmaker.  This is truly an exciting night for all of us.  I guess we all fantasize about something like this happening and now it's a reality.  I'm very pleased.  And thank you.JACK ROLLINS:I understand that Bob Hope had made a statement earlier today that Woody's nomination was gonna have some importance in bringing comedy forward in the Academy affairs.  And if his winning tonight is another step in that direction, I'm delighted.  I want to thank the members of the Academy for this great honor.  Thank you."," Charles H.

 Best Picture, Kramer vs. Kramer,"Oh boy.  I grew up in a home that's been associated with this business for fifty-one years.  This [pats the Oscar] has always been very important to all of us as a representation of excellence.I stand here very happy and very blessed.  Blessed because a person named Avery Corman wrote a book called ""Kramer vs. Kramer.""  Lucky because Richard Fischoff came to work for me that week and found the book.  Blessed because Bob Benton was free, and he wrote and directed it.  And I was lucky enough to be able to get, along with Bob and the words he wrote, Dustin and Meryl and Jane and Justin.  And it's a film that's made with love, and it's made about love.  And it was cut by Jerry, and Néstor shot it.  And it would not have been made had it not been for the encouragement of Columbia Pictures, Frank Price, John Veitch, and most especially two dear friends of mine, Dan Melnick and Sherry Lansing.It is about love, and from four people in my life I have learned more about that than ever.  I speak of Ingeborg Sørensen and her son Adam, and I speak about my children, Bobby and Betsy.  Thank you all very much."," Stanley R. Jaffe, Producer", 1979 (52nd) Academy Awards
 Best Picture, Ordinary People,"On behalf of Wildwood Enterprises and Paramount Pictures I would like to thank the members of the Academy for this award.  From the beginning of production until the release and distribution of the picture there was a special pride shared by all in the making of ""Ordinary People.""  The author Judith Guest, screenwriter Alvin Sargent, editor Jeff Kanew, an excellent cast—Donald, Mary, Tim, Judd—and a dedicated, hard-working crew, to these deserving people we owe our sincere thanks.As far back as four-and-a-half years ago, when Robert Redford acquired the novel, he strongly believed that this could be a very special film.  This belief, along with his sensitive direction, was the inspiration behind the project.  I want to thank Bob for giving me the opportunity to produce this picture and I want to say he must come up here and share this with me.  Bob, wherever you are, come on up.

 Best Picture, Chariots of Fire,"Just for thirty seconds I wish I was Bette Midler.  To the most extraordinary, generous people on God's earth, not just the Academy to whom I have to be held thankful for this, but as a country to have taken what is absolutely a Cinderella picture and awarded it this and come to see it in droves is absolutely extraordinary.  I've got many…your indulgence.  This is a Best Film Award, and three-and-a-half years ago I started out with Colin Welland and the director Hugh Hudson—Could he please stand with me?  We've been together three-and-a-half years, I'd hate not to be with him now.  Hugh. [Director Hugh Hudson joins him onstage.]I have to thank—I don't know where to start.  It starts with my good friend Sandy Lieberson who made it possible in the first place.  Everybody at Twentieth Century Fox.  Mohamed and Dodi Fayed, who came through for us and put their money where my mouth was.  And since coming here, Warner Bros. and The Ladd Company, for falling in love with the film.

 Best Picture, Gandhi,"Ladies and gentlemen, this should be not a moment for regret in any sense, but I have to say that I have the regret that my late partner Moti Kothari, to whom this film was dedicated, is not here to share this award with me. And to his widow Dorothy, and Shanta and Rajni, I send my love and my very grateful thanks for the fact that their father gave me the idea of making this film.Members of the Academy, you have honored, you have seen fit to honor a number of people who have been connected with this film -- Jack and Ben and Billy, and many others.  And particularly without Jack and Ben there would have been no movie.  But I'm sure that they would agree that the person whom you really honor, as Ben suggested, was Mahatma Gandhi himself.  He was an inspiration to millions and millions of people, and the extraordinary thing always seems to me, that he is currently still an inspiration. Your great folk hero Martin Luther King, Jr. was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. Lech Walesa, that noble Polish patriot, came out of prison the other day and said that what he had been attempting to do in the past was not going to work. The only way in which we could find human dignity and peace was through the philosophies and teachings of Gandhi.Gandhi simply asked that we should examine the criteria by which we adjudge the manner of solving our problems.  That surely in the 20th century we human beings searching for our human dignity could find other ways of ultimately solving our problems than blowing the other man's head off.  He begged us to re-examine that criteria.  He believed that if we would but agree, simplistic though it be, that we would not resort to violence in the ultimate.  Then the route that we would take in solving our problems would be a quite different one to the one that we accept now in the acceptance of ultimate confrontation. He begged us to re-examine that criteria.  I believe he had something to say to all of us everywhere in the world.And dear colleagues, in all truth -- because the films that were nominated with me all wished for the same thing, all their makers wanted to say the same thing -- and in all truth it is not me or even Ben or Jack or Billy that you truly honor. You honor Mahatma Gandhi and his plea to all of us to live in peace."," Richard Attenborough, Producer", 1982 (55th) Academy Awards
 Best Picture, Terms of Endearment,"This community -- it took a long time to get the picture made and this community has been generous to this picture from long before it was made, when we were trying to get it done.  I want to acknowledge my co-producers Penney Finkelman and Martin Jurow.  My friends were unfailing through this thing cause it was the kind of experience where you wouldn't have made it without your friends.  I want to tell you that Debra Winger worked on this picture in countless ways for about a year with as much as a person can give to a picture.There was a lot about, you know, every studio turning it down.  I think it's much more significant that a Hollywood studio made it, and that Hollywood studio was flexible, and that the studio ended up happy that it made it -- I think that's significant, too, that there was an audience for this picture.  I want to thank Barry Diller and Michael Eisner, Frank Mancuso, and Jeff Katzenberg, and Larry Marks.  And this is an extraordinary evening for us. There is no way to express the gratitude.  Thank you very much."," James L. Brooks, Producer", 1983 (56th) Academy Awards
 Best Picture, Amadeus,"Thank you.  Nine years ago Audrey Hepburn gave us Oscars for ""Cuckoo's Nest,"" and tonight Sir Laurence Olivier for ""Amadeus.""  What a wonderful and rewarding profession for a movie fan.  Gregory Peck and Larry Gelbart asked me to speak for fifty-five minutes to make it a four-hour show but I only have thirty-two minutes prepared.There're five pictures nominated this year.  All had a curious relationship in the fact that the filmmakers who made them had to fight, and overcame many obstacles to make their films and to film their visions.  One has to be proud to be a peer of the people who made ""Killing Fields,"" ""Passage to India,"" ""Soldier's Story"" and ""Places in the Heart.""Our thanks to Orion Pictures, and distributors and theater owners throughout the world who recognized ""Amadeus"" before it was released.  And thanks must be given to others because, regardless of what you might have heard or what you might think, I really didn't do it all myself.  To Neville Marriner, Twyla Tharp, and Josef Svoboda, whose creative contributions to ""Amadeus"" do not fit into any Academy category.  To a marvelous group of actors whose talents no longer remain unsung.  And to a Mike Hausman-led crew composed of Americans, Englishmen, Frenchmen, Italians, Czechs, and nine translators.And my love to my children:  Jon, Athena, Josh, Dorian.  To the boys from Myrtle and Monroe.  And to the gang up in Berkeley who were behind the picture all the way.  Thank you very much."," Saul Zaentz, Producer", 1984 (57th) Academy Awards

And Frans Afman of Credit Lyonnais, for having the money in the Philippine jungle when I really needed it.  And to some other people [pulling out his notes]...Arthur Manson, and Marion Billings, and Andrea Jaffe.  And to my wife Anne, who has been my business partner for sixteen years and has been with me every step of the way. And to our children, Peter, Evan and Stephanie, for urging me to make ""Platoon"" because their generation wanted to know more.  And to Dale Dye and the entire cast and crew of ""Platoon,"" for their dedication.  And particularly Oliver Stone, for his brilliance.  I would not be here tonight but for Oliver Stone's brilliance, and I thank you, Oliver.The power of the motion picture medium is awesome.  ""Platoon"" has brought to this generation a new perspective of war:  That war is not glamorous, that it maims and it kills.  And if perhaps ""Platoon"" could also influence people in this and other countries of the world to hesitate before they engage in war, to demand facts and ask questions before the bombs, then we, not just those of us that made ""Platoon"" but the entire motion picture industry, will have succeeded beyond our wildest imagination.  Thank you so very much.  I will treasure this [holding up his Oscar] forever."," Arnold Kopelson, Producer", 1986 (59th) Academy Awards
 Best Picture, The Last Emperor,"Well, I must say this is a truly imperial evening for me and for everybody who worked very hard with me on this picture.  I'd like to thank about thirty thousand people who helped us make this picture.  It took four years to make and it was very, very rewarding.  This award from the Academy is a real affirmation for me that independent cinema can be epic and both popular.  And I hope that this Oscar will mean that many, many more people can see this picture in America.  Of course, I want to thank Bernardo for inviting me on this incredible voyage of discovery.

Peter Guber and Jon Peters, for being exactly what executive producers should be in supporting us all the way.  To Gail Mutrux, for supporting me.  I'd like to thank—boy, Michael Ovitz and Rosalie Swedlin for standing by this for weeks and years.  I'd like to thank Dustin and Tom.  And a wonderful studio that really doesn't exist anymore:  Lee Rich, Tony Thomopoulos and Roger Birnbaum who were United Artists, and really exactly what anybody could want out of a studio.  And the producer [of the Awards telecast] says that we're not allowed to, we shouldn't really thank our families.  We're supposed to wait until we go backstage and use the pay phone. But he doesn't know my family.  I'd like to thank my wife Lezlie, who really stood by me.  Our two foster children, Jack and Rebecca.  And, boy, if I didn't mention my mother I'd be a dead man:  Dorothy King in Great Barrington. Thank you."," Mark Johnson, Producer", 1988 (61st) Academy Awards

Our thanks to a wonderful crew, those in Atlanta as well as those here.  And we thank David Brown for being very instrumental in the early stages of this production.

Allyn Stewart and Jake Eberts, for taking care of us.  And Bob Daley, Terry Semel, Robbie Friedman, Joel Wayne, Rob Friedman—I said that twice.  Guy McElwaine, Ronni Chasen and very much the group in London at Majestic.  And I would like to thank Ronni Chasen.

To a cast and crew who never said never, you can't do it.  To Orion Pictures and Majestic Films International, for their never-ending support on a film that was difficult.

And to my two best friends, Kevin Costner and Michael Blake, who allowed me to participate in this.

I will never forget what happened here tonight.  My family will never forget what happened here.  My Native American brothers and sisters across the country, especially the Lakota Sioux, will never forget.  People I went to school with will never forget.

 Best Picture, Forrest Gump,"I'd like to say thank you to the Academy for this honor.  And it's just so wonderful to be acknowledged with a great group of movies.  Nine years ago I met a very special man who has since taken me on an amazing journey.  There were many people who gave him gifts along the way.  Eric Roth, you gave ""Forrest"" a soul.  Tom Hanks, you gave ""Forrest"" a heart.  And Bob Zemeckis, you gave ""Forrest"" a vision.  Steve Tisch and Steve Starkey, you were great co-parents.  ""Forrest"" was a labor of love to many people:  our wonderful cast and crew, Sherry, Jon, Michelle, John, Barry, Arthur, all the people at Paramount, Winston, Craig, Rand.  To my parents, grandparents, family, thank you for your support.  To my husband Mark Canton, for your love and always saying go make this dream a reality.  My parents always said dreams can come true, and to my own children, Dorothy, Henry and James, if you doubt it, please remember tonight because I always will.  Thank you.STEVE TISCH:All over the political map people have been calling ""Forrest"" their own.  But ""Forrest Gump"" isn't about politics or conservative values.  It's about humanity.  It's about respect, tolerance and unconditional love.  And tonight we should all feel proud that we are in a business where we entertain, we educate, and we empower.  I'd like to thank my family, my parents Joan and Bob, love to Jamie and to my two wonderful children, Hilary and Willy, and to my four best friends.  And finally, thanks to all the ""Forrest Gumps"" in the world.STEVE STARKEY:Well, I truly want to thank the Academy for making me the final person to thank them tonight.  Now I don't know if it was destiny or if it was chance that brought together the talented cast and extraordinary crew of ""Forrest Gump,"" but maybe as ""Forrest"" said: ""Maybe it was both, maybe both were happening at the same time.""  But in any case, as I look back I can't imagine making this film without any one of them or without the commitment of Sherry Lansing and Paramount Studios.  But most of all, the picture could not have been made without the gentle spirit of Tom Hanks and the guidance and inspiration of the guy we fondly call Bob Z, the truly visionary director Bob Zemeckis.  And I wish to thank them all, and especially my wife Olivia who has stood beside me over the years in everything I've done.  And hello to my parents.

Producers are supposed to not be in love with them, but I love 'em.  And I love writers and directors, too.  Uh, and everyone who worked on, the whole crew, everyone who worked on the picture for what they did in making the picture happen.  When we were shut down, ran out of money, everyone stayed there.  In Italy, without pay.  And we had no money to pay 'em.  And then Harvey and Bob Weinstein came through and financed the picture -- and we had final cut, though.  And all, everyone just who was involved, with all the people at Miramax who were wonderful in working on the picture. But before, I wanna tell one Shakespeare story that I wish I could remember the writer, but I can't.  Uh, Shakespeare, the definition... Shakespeare was defined as an early plagiarizer of Freud.  Okay, I like it.ANTHONY MINGHELLA:[To Zaentz:] Thank Michael Ondaatje.SAUL ZAENTZ:I want to thank -- no, two others, not to thank but to say one of the best things that's happened to Michael Ondaatje, Anthony and myself, we each made two friends.

I can't act and I can't compose and I can't do visual effects, so I guess that's why I'm producing.  But I have a lot of people that I have to thank on behalf of both Jim and myself.  I want to thank all the nominees here this evening, and all the people that again they've already thanked.  Our incredible cast, we would not be here without you.

He thanked everybody and did everything I was going to say.  And my eyes are still sort of doing pinwheels from the last one, so I just want to say a couple of things.  We're here tonight to celebrate the magic of movies.  And I'm grateful every day to get to be a part of that magic and a practitioner in it, and I love it.  And tonight has been such a great celebration for us.  And it seems to somehow express this strange wave that's happened with ""Titanic,"" where people all over the world have opened their hearts to this movie.  And that's so gratifying to all of us that worked on it and we'll be forever grateful to them, the audience, and I know a lot of you are watching at home.In the midst of all this euphoria, it's kind of hard for us to remember that this euphoria and the success is for a film that's based on a real event that happened, where real people died, that shocked the world in 1912.  So I'd just like everybody to go with me just for a second on something here.  I'd like to do a few seconds of silence in remembrance of the 1,500 men, women and children who died when the great ship died.  The message of ""Titanic"" of course is, that if the great ship can sink, the unthinkable can happen, the future is unknowable, the only thing that we truly own is today.  Life is precious.  So during these few seconds I'd like you to also listen to the beating of your own heart which is the most precious thing in the world.  Join me please in a few seconds of silence for ""Titanic"" . . . . Thank you very much. That's about as much as I'm sure Gil Cates can stand.

 Best Picture, The Hurt Locker,"Thank you so much.  This has been such a dream, beyond a dream, for all of us who have lived for so long with this story.  And, you know, we had this fantasy of making our film our way with the talent that we hoped to have, and hopefully we would find a distributor and somebody might even like the movie. So to be standing here, this was really, truly, honestly never part of anything we even imagined in our wildest dreams.  So thank you so much to each and every member of the Academy for really honoring us beyond anything we could've imagined.GREG SHAPIRO:Thank you to the Academy.  This is really unreal and extremely humbling.  We also have to thank our intrepid financier and fellow producer, Nicolas Chartier, who bet on this movie when no one else would.  The incredible support that we got from CAA, particularly Joel Lubin, Roeg Sutherland, Brian Siberell.  Our entire cast and crew, and our fearless director.MARK BOAL:Our fearless director.  And also, we owe a deep debt of gratitude, by the way, to Summit Entertainment and Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger for distributing this film.  And thank you, Mom.  I forgot to thank you before.KATHRYN BIGELOW:I was just gonna reiterate that with Rob and Patrick, who took a very brave shot with this movie, and we owe them dearly.  And perhaps one more dedication:  To men and women all over the world who, sorry to reiterate, but wear a uniform.  But even not just the military – hazmat, emergency, firemen. You know, they're there for us and we're there for them.  Thank you.  Thank you."," Kathryn Bigelow, Mark Boal, Nicolas Chartier and Greg Shapiro, Producers", 2009 (82nd) Academy Awards

 Best Picture, The Artist,"I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to you, members of the Academy, to you, Harvey, not only because we receive tonight the award that any filmmaker would ever dream to receive, but because you're offering me tonight the opportunity to pay tribute to a member of this Academy that I miss so much: the Oscar winner Claude Berri. And he directed movies like ""The Two of Us,"" ""Jean de Florette,"" and produced and worked with directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Milos Forman, Pedro Almodovar, Roman Polanski. And I always thought and remember, will I ever one day be able to work with such director, a director that could stand in front of these example? And tonight I know I do, because I am the producer of Michel Hazanavicius. And I am glad to be his producer.MICHEL HAZANAVICIUS:Okay, thank you. I'd like to say very, very important things. I want to say hi to my kids, and it's six in the morning in Paris so you should go to bed in thirty seconds. I want to say to my wife, Bérénice Bejo, who's here, that I love you. But it's not just that, it's about the movie. You inspired the movie and you're the soul of the movie and the positive feeling of the movie. Thank you for being this in the movie and in my life.

 Best Picture, Argo,"I know what you're thinking: the three sexiest producers alive. I want to thank the Academy; this is truly an honor. There are literally thousands of people to thank, so thankfully I'm not gonna thank them now. I'm going to thank everybody personally in the next few weeks, but there are a couple of people I want to acknowledge. I want to acknowledge my partner in crime and my great friend, George Clooney, who... Everybody should be so lucky to have a partner who is as talented and as humorous and who has as much integrity. So, thank you, George. I want to thank my beautiful wife Lysa; you make everything better. And to our kids, Maya and Olivia, I love you guys. I hope your old man's not embarrassing you up here. The reason I wanted to speak first – I wanted to speak before Ben – was Ben is a producer on the film and he is also our director. And I thought it would be awkward for Ben to thank himself, but it's not awkward for me. So on behalf of George and myself, I want to thank you, Ben. You directed a hell of a film. Couldn't be more proud of the film; couldn't be more proud of Ben. So ladies and gentlemen, our co-producer and the director of ""Argo"": Ben Affleck.BEN AFFLECK:Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. I know eventually that thing is gonna start to go, so forgive me if this is a little bit quick. I want to acknowledge Steven Spielberg, who I feel is a genius and a towering talent among us. I want to acknowledge the other eight films. There are eight great films that have every right, as much a right to be up here as we do. I want to acknowledge them and thank them for what they did, and for many of them who didn't even get nominated this year.I want to thank, you know, I mean, Jack McNiece*, and Jerry Speck*, and Marty Brest, and my brother, and my mom and dad, and Patrick Whitesell, and Tony Mendez, who let us do his story. Thank you. And I'm gonna forget – I thank everyone in the movie, on the movie, worked on the movie, did anything with this movie, gets thanked. I want to thank Canada. I want to thank our friends in Iran living in terrible circumstances right now. I want to thank my wife – who I don't normally associate with Iran, but... I want to thank you for working on our marriage for ten Christmases. It's good. It is work but it's the best kind of work, and there's no one I'd rather work with.And I just want to say, you know, I was here fifteen years ago or something, and, you know, I had no idea what I was doing. I stood out here in front of you all, really just a kid, and I went out, you know, and I never thought that I would be back here. And I am because of so many of you who are here tonight, because of this Academy, because of so many wonderful people who extended themselves to me when they had nothing to benefit from it in Hollywood. You know what I mean? I couldn't get 'em a job. I want to thank them and I want to thank what they taught me, which is that you have to work harder than you think you possibly can. You can't hold grudges. It's hard but you can't hold grudges. And it doesn't matter how you get knocked down in life, because that's gonna happen. All that matters is that you gotta get up.

Not only to comment, maybe, but to maybe have a shot at reshaping that world. It's a long way from that room to this hall and I couldn't accept this without, without mentioning a couple of allies I'd picked up on the way. One, of course, is my brilliant mentor, Stanley Kramer; a man of courage, talent, and a man of his word.

One to Bill Graf, our executive producer, who brought Freddy and myself together and suggested that we have a go at  it.

She's, I think, a bit too self-effacing to want me to deliver a sermon on the importance of a writer's contribution to films, but I think she'd allow me to say as a director that the best acting, the most brilliant photography, and the most wonderful sets and costumes add up to absolutely nothing, as we all know, without a good script.

I want to thank Bernardo for taking me to China and for giving me the chance to discover another half of the world we live in. I want to thank Jeremy, the producer.

And he has made us both believe in movies for years.  And say hello to my daughter Lola.BERNARDO BERTOLUCCI:Thank you.  I've been walking all around and they didn't let me in and then I show my statue and they let me in, and I just came on time.  Thank you.  Thank you.

 Writing (Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium), Dangerous Liaisons,"Well, this [holding up the Oscar] is great but anyone would fly across the Atlantic to get a kiss from Michelle Pfeiffer.  I want to thank Norma Heyman and Hank Moonjean and my fellow producers for showing a beginner the ropes.  I want to thank Norma for putting me in touch with Bernie Brillstein.  Peter Chernin and Ileen Maisel, without whose courage I think the film wouldn't exist, and faith in it.  And finally I want to thank the two co-recipients of this:  Choderlos de Laclos, who's having about as  good a year as is possible to have if you're a dead writer, and of course Stephen Frears, who created the atmosphere for everyone to be able to do their best work.

She's from Rosebud, South Dakota.[Doris Leader Charge translates the following into the Lakota Sioux Native American language after each sentence:]  My success began when I started to read books.  Dreams come out of books.  And the dream that came to me was to do something beneficial for as many people as I could.

 Writing (Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen), Coming Home,"I wrote my screenplay in 1973 when our country was still at war in Vietnam. I was inspired by Vietnam veterans and the women who loved them.  They told me of the painful experiences they had suffered in the name of patriotism. Tonight, six years later, I have an Oscar, but for the people of whom I wrote the war still goes on.  I'm thinking of them tonight.  Thank you.WALDO SALT:I would like to thank particularly and only, not because of anything except that I think they are the people who made the picture, some of the people that we talked to, some of the people who shared their lives, their war, their post-war, their pain, their difficulties with us that made the heart of the screenplay.  Bobby Muller and his fine wife, Bill Hager, T. Hager, Ron Kovic, Roger Steffens and his Mary, Tim Page, and so many others that I can't list; I hope that they will forgive me.  Some of the people, who would prefer not to be named I believe, who worked in the veterans facilities here in the Bronx and who shared their experiences with us.  To all of the men who fought in Vietnam: those who lost their lives, those who lost their innocence, and those who, working with defoliants, still don't know whether they've lost their lives.  Thank you.ROBERT C. JONES:I would like to thank our extremely talented director, Hal Ashby; producer, Jerome Hellman; and a really, really amazing cast.  Thank you."," Story by Nancy Dowd;  Screenplay by Waldo Salt, Robert C. Jones", 1978 (51st) Academy Awards
 Writing (Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen), Breaking Away,"Oh God.  Where's Sam?  I need Sam up here.  God.  There's absolutely nothing I love as much as writing.  To get an award for doing something you love seems like a luxury I never expected.  I was gonna do original stuff, cause it's...and it seems like this is a, there's a tradition here of thanking people and I think I will do that instead.  Sam Cohn, without him I would not be here at all.  Peter Yates, without him the screenplay would not have been written; it would not have been written as well and it certainly wouldn't have looked like it did.  Let's see, there's Gareth Wigan – oh my God, I'm getting to the past and present of studios like Benton did – Alan Ladd, the present Fox people.The last thing I want to say is that long before I actually saw America, my first glimpses of it were in a movie house in Yugoslavia.  It was a western, ""Stagecoach,"" and it seemed like a wonderful, endless frontier of a country where these good and evil characters fought it out for the soul of America. And after all these years of being here I am just so grateful to be given an opportunity to send back a film and to tell 'em that I find it very much like the place I had seen originally:  The good and the bad still fight it out; the good still tend to win in the end.

Tonight I'm here for ""Melvin and Howard"" but there are years in between for me and for all writers when there are no awards.

 Writing (Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen), Gandhi,"I wrote a long movie, I'm gonna make a long speech.  Ah, no.  Like everybody who stands up here I've got a lot of debts; I just want to acknowledge three. One to Dickie, Sir Richard, for having the faith and courage to trust me with his dream, put up with me once it became mine too, and fulfilling both our dreams with such brilliance and honesty.  And to Ben, for a performance that went beyond dreams.  For me it's still emotional to watch Ben although I've seen it like fifty or sixty times.  I think it's so moving and so profound that it does an honor to our whole industry and justice even to the man that inspired the whole film.And then I would like to thank Gandhi himself.  When I came to this material I despaired for it as drama and I didn't think it had much relevance in a world as cruel and as harsh as ours.  But as I came to know the man I found that he knew everything we all know about our cruelty, our selfishness, our greed, our fears.  But he also had a faith in the kind of stubborn resolution that we all have to be a little humane, to be a little understanding, to be a little, even, brotherly.  And he lived his life in a way that showed that if we called upon that in ourselves and in our enemies, that there was hope for each of us and maybe for this planet.  He gave me that.  I tried in writing the screenplay to give it back in a way that he would have approved.  I thank him.  I thank you.", John Briley, 1982 (55th) Academy Awards

He's here, I've seen him.So anyway, thanks to the Academy, to Warner Bros., everybody at Warner Bros. Alan Mak and Felix Chong who wrote ""Infernal Affairs."" The producers present and not present, the agents, everybody who made ""The Departed"" such a success. Thanks to Marty and Leo for reading the script and calling each other and saying let's make it. And Thelma. Everyone who worked on ""The Departed"" was, it's easy to say, on the top of their game before they started, and under Marty's direction it only got higher after that. Thank you very much.", Screenplay by William Monahan, 2006 (79th) Academy Awards
 Writing (Adapted Screenplay), No Country for Old Men,"Thank you very much for this.  Thank you, Scott Rudin, for bringing us this novel and giving us the opportunity to make the movie.  I think whatever success we've had in this area has been entirely attributable to how selective we are:  we've only adapted Homer and Cormac McCarthy.  So, thank you.ETHAN COEN:We, uh... thank you very much.", Written for the screen by Joel Coen &amp; Ethan Coen, 2007 (80th) Academy Awards
 Writing (Adapted Screenplay), Slumdog Millionaire,"Thank you very much indeed.  There are certain places in the universe you never imagine standing.  For me it's the moon, the South Pole, the Miss World podium, and here.  It's a tremendous honor, so thank you to the Academy.I certainly wouldn't be standing here tonight without Vikas Swarup, who wrote the book without which none of ""Slumdog"" would ever have happened.  So thank you, Vikas.  Tessa Ross from Film4, who shoved the manuscript into my hand and said, ""This is yours, you must go to India.""  Thank you.  My parents who've always supported me throughout everything.  My wife Jane, for whom repressed English writers have to write love stories, 'cause they can't really say what they mean.  Susan Landau and Charlotte Knight, both my manager and my agent. And of course the wonderful Dev, the wonderful Latika, and the cast and crew of the film who have taught me so much about India and so much about writing, and they've all sort of changed my life.

 Writing (Adapted Screenplay), The Social Network,"Thank you.  It's impossible to describe what it feels like to be handed the same award that was given to Paddy Chayefsky thirty-five years ago for another movie with ""network"" in the title.  His was an original screenplay; this is an adaptation of a book by Ben Mezrich, so I'm accepting this on his behalf as well.  There are a lot of people who've worked hard in my corner for a long time and it seems like the right moment to thank them:  my assistant Lauren Lohman; my researcher Ian Reichbach; my long suffering press rep, Joy Fehily, and all the women of Prime; Rich Heller, Bill Tanner, Andy Forshay*; my agents Ari Emanuel and Jason Spitz, who never blow my cover and reveal that I would happily do this for free; and my mom and dad, who made a life for me where I get to be a part of nights like this.I wrote this movie but David Fincher made this movie, and he did it with an ungodly artfulness.  Someone this talented has no business being the nicest guy in the world, but he is, and he made the movie of any screenwriter's dreams.  He had help from Amy Pascal, Michael Lynton and everyone at Sony whose only mandate was to make it good.  From Dana Brunetti, Ceán Chaffin, Mike De Luca, and America's best living film producer, Scott Rudin.  And from Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Armie Hammer again, Rashida Jones, Rooney Mara, and a cast and crew that followed their leader's example: that good enough was never good enough.  This movie is going to be a source of pride for me every day for the rest of my life.  That is an un-repayable gift.  All I can say is thank you.Roxy Sorkin, your father just won the Academy Award.  I'm gonna have to insist on some respect from your guinea pig.  Thank you very much.", Screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, 2010 (83rd) Academy Awards

And we also share it, in particular, with Kaui Hart Hemmings, our beautiful Hawaiian flower, for her novel. And on a brief personal note, if I may. My mother is here with me from Omaha and -- hold the applause -- and after watching the show a few years ago she made me promise that if I ever won another Oscar, I had to dedicate it to her just like Javier Bardem did with his mother. So, Mom, this one's for you. S'agapo poli. And thanks for letting me skip nursery school so we could go to the movies.

And I want to dedicate this to a man named Tony Mendez. Thirty-three years ago, Tony, using nothing but his creativity and his intelligence, got six people out of a very bad situation. And so I want to dedicate this to him and the Taylors and the Sheardowns and people all over the world in the U.S., in Canada, in Iran, who use creativity and intelligence to solve problems non-violently.

And, Gayle, seeing you here tonight and smiling, you take away all that soul-crushing inadequacy.All the praise goes to Solomon Northup. Those are his words; that is his life. All the thanks goes to the entire crew, the entire cast. To everyone at Fox Searchlight, at River Road, at New Regency and Plan B. Mr. Pitt.

I'm so indebted to you for it.So here's, here's the thing. Alan Turing never got to stand on a stage like this and look out at all of these disconcertingly attractive faces, and I do. And that's the most unfair thing I think I've ever heard. So, in this brief time here, what I want to use it to do is to say this: When I was sixteen years old I tried to kill myself, because I felt weird and I felt different and I felt like I did not belong. And now I'm standing here. And so I would like for this moment to be for that kid out there who feels like she's weird or she's different or she doesn't fit in anywhere. Yes, you do. I promise you do. You do. Stay weird. Stay different. And then when it's your turn and you are standing on this stage, please pass the same message to the next person who comes along. Thank you so much. I love you guys.", Written by Graham Moore, 2014 (87th) Academy Awards

 Writing (Adapted Screenplay), Call Me by Your Name,"Well, I'll try and keep it—I'll make it as fast I can, before the music plays. My rule number one for a screenwriter who adapts a novel is first thank the author: André Aciman, who wrote the story about first love and who's here tonight. A story familiar to most of us; whether we're straight or gay, or somewhere in between, we've all gone through first love, I hope, and come out the other side mostly intact. Though maybe not without the benefit of loving parents like the Perlmans in this film. I want to thank our sensitive and sensible director, Luca Guadagnino, as well as my neighbors in Upstate New York, Peter Spears and Brian Swardstrom, who offered me this job. Of course, I want to thank the film's wonderful emotion-filled actors; I wouldn't be standing up here tonight without their inspired help.And I wouldn't be standing up here without the inspired help I received from my life's partners who are gone: our writer Ruth Jhabvala, who received this award twice, and our fearless producer Ismail Merchant.

If I took the time to thank all of the people, very honestly, that are responsible for this award we'd be here much too long.  But naturally to Marty Ransohoff, and Filmways and Paramount.  I am deeply indebted for them letting us even make the film, because nobody wanted to let us make it.  To Steve Shagan and John Avildsen.  It would take much too much and much too long and I'll have to do it personally later.  And to a cast and a crew of people, I've never in my life been connected with anything that meant more to me and worked with so many wonderful professional people that cared and loved something so much. And they made it one of the great, great moments of my life, the making of that film, and that's equal to this honor, just the privilege of working with them, truthfully.  And I thank them all and I love them and respect them.I just want to say one more thing.  In recent years especially there has been a great deal of criticism about this award.  And probably a great deal of that criticism is very justified.  I would just like to say that whether it's justified or not, I think it is one hell of an honor and I am thrilled.  And I thank you all very, very much.", Jack Lemmon, 1973 (46th) Academy Awards
 Actor, Harry and Tonto,"Thank you, Glenda.  Ladies and gentlemen and members of the Academy.  What other words beside thank you, Paul Mazursky and Josh Greenfeld, for a gem of a script.  And particularly for my wife Barbara, and my agent/manager/father-confessor, William Francis Xavier McCaffrey, for twenty-five years, who said two words to me:  Do it!  You are old!  Thank you very much.", Art Carney, 1974 (47th) Academy Awards
 Actor, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,"Well, I guess this proves there are as many nuts in the Academy as anywhere else.  But, since you gave me the chance, I'm really happy to get an opportunity to thank Saul and Michael and Louise and Brad and Lawrence and Bo, and all of the guys in the company, all of the feebs brigade.  And I'd like to thank Miss Pickford who, incidentally, I believe was the first actor to get a percentage of her pictures.  And speaking of a percentage, last but not least, my agent, who about ten years ago advised me that I had no business being an actor.  Thank you.", Jack Nicholson, 1975 (48th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Network,"For some obscure reason I'm up here accepting an award for Peter Finch, or Finchie as everybody who knew him called him.  There is no reason for me to be here.  There's only one person who should be up here accepting this award and that's the person who Finch wanted up here accepting his award:  Mrs. Peter Finch.  Are you in the house, Eletha?  Come up and get your award.MRS. PETER FINCH:I want to say thanks to the members of the Academy and my husband.  I wish he was here tonight to be with us all, but since he isn't here I'll always cherish this for him.  And before he died he said to me, ""Darling, if I win I want to say thanks to my fellow actors who have given me encouragement over the years; and thanks to Paddy Chayefsky who have given him the part; and thanks to Barry who have tell us to come from Jamaica, to come and do this part.""  And he says, ""Most of all, thanks to you, darling, for sending the right vibes the right way.  And thanks, the members of the Academy Award."" Thank you all.", Peter Finch, 1976 (49th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, The Goodbye Girl,"I didn't prepare anything.  Ahhm... [laughs].  Wait a second, am I here? Yes, okay.  First I will embarrass Ray Stark by saying that I owe him everything; and he is a great man.  To Herb Ross, who is the only true gentleman I've ever known in my life.  To Herb, Marsha, and Neil, and Quinn. I could go on and on and on and I don't want to leave.  Can I rent this [referring to the podium] now?  Thank you very much.", Richard Dreyfuss, 1977 (50th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Coming Home,"I am still reeling really from the appearances just recently on this stage. I don't think there's an actor here or watching this proceeding tonight who doesn't acknowledge a great debt to the continuing legacy of Laurence Olivier. And his presence here tonight has put a great perspective and just, on the proceedings for me, and a warm and generous and dignified one, and I'm not quite able to recover from it, I tell you.The performances this year in this category are remarkable, really.  I am a great fan of the other members of the nominated body.  And I know that we are all extremely aware of the extraordinary performances that we have been selected to represent.  For my own part I have, as we all do, many people to thank for a performance which stands among this group of performances.  I would like to thank everyone, but I select to thank a few who represent the many.I would like to thank Bruce Dern, my friend, for his encouragement and his wonderful performance, and his friendship.  I would like to thank Jerry Hellman, who produced also ""Midnight Cowboy;"" is an extraordinary man, a great producer, a tenacious fighter, who keeps us all healthy and has great taste. I would like to thank Hal Ashby, a remarkable, a remarkable person who was so helpful in getting me to myself and encouraging my performance.  And finally I would like to thank Jane, whose great dignity as a human being – it's a good thing she's not here to see this – is very moving to me.  And finally, I'm carrying with me all the men who gave me so much of their experience to deal with, who have contributed so much:  the people in chairs, and the veterans, and the civilians, and the walkers, who are so strongly represented in what I'd call my work.  Thank you very much.", Jon Voight, 1978 (51st) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Kramer vs. Kramer,"Thank you.  [Inspects the Oscar.]  He has no genitalia and he's holding a sword.  I'd like to thank my parents for not practicing birth control.I'm up here with mixed feelings.  I've been critical of the Academy, and for reason.  I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to be able to work.  I am greatly honored for being chosen by the producer, Stanley Jaffe, and the director, Bob Benton, and to have worked in a family with them, and with Meryl and with Justin, who if he loses again we'll have to give him a lifetime achievement award.  And to Jane Alexander and to Jerry Greenberg and to Néstor and to the crew on the film who was part of that family.  And to the crew and to the directors like Bob Fosse and Mike Nichols and John Schlesinger that I've worked with before.  We are laughed at when we are up here, sometimes, for thanking.  But when you work on a film you discover that there are people who are giving that artistic part of themself that goes beyond a paycheck, and they are never up here.  And many of them are not members of the Academy, and we never hear of them.  But this Oscar is a symbol, I think, and it is given for appreciation from those people whom we never see.  They are part of our life.I refuse to believe that I beat Jack Lemmon, that I beat Al Pacino, that I beat Peter Sellers.  I refuse to believe that Robert Duvall lost.  We are a part of an artistic family.  There are sixty thousand actors in this Academy – pardon me – in the Screen Actors Guild, and probably a hundred thousand in Equity.  And most actors don't work, and a few of us are so lucky to have a chance to work with writing and to work with directing.  Because when you're a broke actor you can't write; you can't paint; you have to practice accents while you're driving a taxi cab.  And to that artistic family that strives for excellence, none of you have ever lost and I am proud to share this with you. And I thank you.", Dustin Hoffman, 1979 (52nd) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Raging Bull,"[He pulls out his notes.]  I forgot my lines so the director wrote them down for me.  I want to thank everyone.  Since it's said so often, but it's true and it's...what can I say?  I want to thank Bruno, Richard Bruno, for the terrific costumes.  Frank Warner, Cis Corman, Pete Savage, and if Pete wasn't involved in the film he wouldn't have gotten it started—I'm a little nervous, excuse me—the film never would have gotten started.  Mike Westmore, for the makeup.  Mary Keats, the late Jean Burt Reilly, Irwin Winkler and Bob Chartoff.  Vickie La Motta and all the other wives, and Joey La Motta even though he's suing us.  I hope that settles soon enough so I can go over to his house and eat once in a while.  And Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader, who wrote the script.  And of course, Jake La Motta, whose life it's all about.  And Marty Scorsese, who gave me and all the other actors and everyone on the film all the love and trust that anyone could give anyone and is just wonderful as a director.  And I want to thank my mother and father for having me.  And my grandmother and grandfather, for having them.  And everyone else involved in the film.  And I hope that I can share this with anyone that it means anything to and the rest of the world, and especially all the terrible things that are happening.  I love everyone.", Robert De Niro, 1980 (53rd) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, On Golden Pond,"Oh, Dad, I'm so happy and proud for you.  My father didn't really believe that this was going to happen but he told me a while back that if it did he wanted his wife Shirlee to accept the award for him.  But Shirlee wanted to be with him tonight, as is her way, and so I'm here.And first and foremost I want to thank on behalf of my father the members of the Academy who voted to give him this award.  I know that he's watching right now and I know that he's very, very honored and very happy and surprised.  And I'll bet when he heard it just now, I bet he said, ""Hey, ain't I lucky?""  As though luck had anything to do with it.  I know also that he has tremendous respect for the other actors that were nominated and has always felt a little strange about these things, these competitions, because it's like comparing apples and oranges, and he feels very proud to have been among such a wonderful group.And I know that he feels that he would never have won this if it hadn't been for Katharine Hepburn.  And if ""On Golden Pond"" is one of the highlights of his life, one of the main reasons is because of her, having the chance to work with her and to become her friend.  And I know that one of the other reasons that he feels the film was so special is because of the quality of the crew. Every one of them, many of whose talents have been recognized tonight in the nominations.  And the wonderful cast: Dougie McKeon, Dabney Coleman, Bill Lanteau, me—he's a proud father.  The man who pulled us all together, our producer Bruce Gilbert.  He is, my father is so happy, he feels so fortunate to have been able to play the role of  ""Norman Thayer,"" a character that he loves a lot and understands very well.  And for this he'd like to thank the sensitive man who wrote the words, who's already been honored tonight, Ernest Thompson.  And for the tremendous talent and guidance of our director Mark Rydell, he's very, very grateful.  We all became like a family during the filming and we sort of stayed together since.  People call him up and stay in touch and come to visit him, and so it's like we've stayed a family, and it's made my father very, very happy.  And he wants to thank Marble Arch and Universal for their support of the movie ""On Golden Pond.""He also feels very lucky to have been able to spend a summer in such a beautiful part of our country, northern New Hampshire, and he wants to thank all the people there who were so friendly and welcoming to us.  And he was very happy, and so was I and are we, to have had our two families together, the Haydens and the Fondas, on the beautiful shores of that lake so that we could get to know each other even more.  He wishes my brother Peter were here tonight, but Peter is somewhere in the jungles of the Philippines in front of a camera right now, like a good Fonda.  And I know that lastly, but really first, he is thanking Shirlee Fonda who has been his loving support for seventeen years, who he calls his Rock of Gibralter.  I think she's his ""Ethel Thayer.""  Dad, me and all the grandchildren are coming over with it right away.  Thank you.", Henry Fonda, 1981 (54th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Gandhi,"Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Academy, you have bereft me of all words.  But that's not good enough; I am custodian of this award for a lot of people.  Let me say before continuing any further that I was overwhelmed to be mentioned in the same breath as the other four gentlemen who were nominated with me.This film was dedicated to Pandit Nehru, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, and Motilal Kothari, all men of great vision and courage.  It was made by my friend Sir Richard Attenborough, another great man of vision and courage.  And for all the men and women who worked on the film, this is an Oscar for vision, for courage, and for acting and for peace.  Thank you.", Ben Kingsley, 1982 (55th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Tender Mercies,"Thank you very much.  I'm very excited, very happy, very moved, very everything tonight, to be up here, to be singled out from among all these very talented people.  I sometimes come to the Academy Awards and watch them year after year, and I get caught up in the spectacle of it, in the event, in the very complex type of entertainment and I guess, I know I forget, that what we're really here for is to single out who we think is the best for that given year.  And if that's what I am to be this year then I appreciate it.  I accept it with an honor and I'm very moved because of that.I think we set out to make a film, a very truthful film, a very good film.  I think Bruce Beresford, Horton Foote, the Hobels, EMI, should all be commended for a very wonderful job that they did in putting this film together.  I think it's a valid film, valid enough that we have gotten very much applause of a certain kind from certain members of the country western community, such as my friend Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings.  And this is certainly a very high level of criticism coming from those people.  And if I didn't have that on one hand, I would feel that this on the other hand was not complete. But the combination of both tonight makes this a very complete and exciting evening for me tonight.  And I want to thank the Academy very much for this award.  I'm very happy.  Thank you.", Robert Duvall, 1983 (56th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Amadeus,"It would be a lie if I told you I didn't know what to say because I've been working on this speech for about twenty-five years.  But you are not going to hear any of those speeches because none of the speeches were less than forty-five seconds.You know, it's easy to gamble everything when you've got nothing to lose, and Milos Forman had a great deal to lose when he gave these brilliant roles to Tom Hulce and me.  And his courage became my inspiration.  There's only one thing that's missing for me tonight and that is to have Tom Hulce standing by my side.[He steps away from the podium, then returns; music starts to play.]  Wait a minute!  Wait, I still have more time!  [Laughs.]  Half of this statue belongs to my beloved wife Kate.  Thank you.", F. Murray Abraham, 1984 (57th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Kiss of the Spider Woman,"I share this with Raul.  Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom [miming his heart beating quickly with his hands], you know... It's incredible.  I didn't expect to be here so I don't know what I'm gonna say.  I want to thank the courageous people in Brazil with whom I made this film.  Saudade, Brazil.  I am very proud to be an actor.  Thank you very much.", William Hurt, 1985 (58th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, The Color of Money,"Paul wanted everybody to know that after coming here for seven other occasions like this...BETTE DAVIS:For two minutes let me say something about you first.ROBERT WISE:Wait a minute, darling.BETTE DAVIS:Just a moment.  I would like to congratulate Paul.  I'm sure he's listening; he is not here tonight.  And this award, Paul, is long overdue.  Robert Wise, a great friend of Mr. Newman's, is accepting for him.  And Mr. Wise is the winner of two Oscars himself: ""The Sound of Music,"" ""West Side Story.""  Yes. Now, now you get on.  That's right.ROBERT WISE:Thank you, my dear.BETTE DAVIS:That's right.[Music plays on.]", Paul Newman, 1986 (59th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Wall Street,"Thank you.  Thank you all very much.  I really want to thank the actors branch of the Academy first, for just being a nominee with four actors that I really admire, and at least one that I consider a really good friend who I admire.  And thank you for that.  And for this fellow [the Oscar] from all of the Academy, I just want to share it with all the good work that was done by all the branches, whether you were nominated or not tonight, but this is all with you.A large part of this award belongs to Oliver Stone.  And not only as the director, but having the courage to cast me in a part that not many people thought I could play.  So I'll always be eternally grateful to him for that. And as a writer, Oliver, with Stanley Weiser, wrote a part that was the best part that I've ever had in my career.  To Charlie and Martin Sheen, two wonderful actors that happen to be father and son, I thank them all very much for their help.  Ed Pressman, Alex Ho, our producers; Leonard Goldberg, Scott Rudin, Tom Sherak of Fox, I thank you, too.I'd like to dedicate this award to William Darrid, Diana Douglas-Darrid, Anne Douglas and Kirk Douglas, my parents and step-parents, who have been extremely supportive and loving to me over the years.  And in particular to my father, who I don't think ever missed one of my college productions, for his continued support and for helping a son step out of his shadow.  I'll be eternally grateful to you, Dad, for that.  Finally, to my wife Diandra and all my old friends who are smiling with me tonight, thank you.  And to all you movie buffs, I just really appreciate, for making this a wonderful moment for me. Thank you.  And good night, Cameron.  I love you.", Michael Douglas, 1987 (60th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Rain Man,"Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Uh...I'm supposed to be jaded by this point.  I'm very honored and I thank the Academy for your support.  And I also thank Tom Hanks and Max von Sydow and James Olmos and my good friend Gene Hackman for their wonderful work, even if they didn't vote for me.  [Laughs] I didn't vote for you guys, either.  It's a pleasure to be here with such good work.I thank my agent Mike Ovitz and Tony Thomopoulos for making this project stick with glue when it was falling apart.  I thank all the producers.  I thank the wonderful cast and the crew of this film who were so emotionally connected with us.  I thank the writers, Barry Morrow and Ron Bass.  And I just want to thank all the people I talked to that were autistic, and their families, and the doctors and all their help.  And our associate producer, Gail Mutrux, got a hold of us, got a hold of for me to meet particularly, Kim Peek, who was the first inspiration of the film, Joe Sullivan and his mother, and my special thanks to Peter and Kevin Guthrie.My father so wanted to be here tonight.  Ironically, a few weeks ago he joined the family of the disabled.  And I understand that the hospital where he's at tonight, that a lot of people that I've met recently are gathered with him with tuxedos and champagne cups and formals.  And they're all watching this show right now on a big TV that they rented.  So to the...[applause].  It was just a few weeks ago that he was at the Golden Globes and he says, ""Let's find Gene Hackman.""  Because he knows we're old roommates.  ""C'mon, let's find Gene.""  Anyway, to the wonderful doctors and nurses and rehabilitation people, and to the families that I've met recently, and to my father and to his new friends:  Here's looking at you.  Thank you.", Dustin Hoffman, 1988 (61st) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, My Left Foot,"You've just provided me with the makings of one hell of a weekend in Dublin.I shared Christy's life for a while with a remarkable young actor called Hugh O'Conor.  But for everyone involved in the film, all our desire to make the film, all the strength that we needed, all the pleasure that we took in making the film came from Christy Brown.  When he was alive he needed very little encouragement to make his voice heard.  Now he needs a little more.  And I'm truly grateful to you that in honoring me with this award you're encouraging Christy to carry on making his mark.  Thank you very much indeed.", Daniel Day Lewis, 1989 (62nd) Academy Awards

Thank you, my co-stars Ron Silver and Glenn, for finally persuading me to do it.  Thank you, Fred Specktor, Anne Hutton, Sally Fischer.  Thank you also, and some of you may understand why, thank you, David Cronenberg.

Thank you all.", Jeremy Irons, 1990 (63rd) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, The Silence of the Lambs,"My God.  I can't believe it.  This is really unexpected.  It's a great honor to be here, especially with such great actors like Nick Nolte and Warren Beatty and Robin Williams, Robert De Niro.  First of all, before I say on, I want to say hello to my mother.  She's in Wales watching this on television with Eve and Jean and Jill and Tony.  My father died eleven years ago tonight, so maybe he had something to do with this as well, I don't know.  But I want to say thank you to the Academy for your tremendous generosity.  To my friend Bob Palmer, my friend and publicist.  My dear, beloved wife Jenni.  And I have many people to thank here in Los Angeles who over the years have given me tremendous support, without whose help I wouldn't be here, I know.  And I am greatly honored and tremendously moved.  And I—God bless you all.  Thank you very much.", Anthony Hopkins, 1991 (64th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Scent of a Woman,"You broke my streak.  The last... I was at an affair recently—thank you so much for this by the way—I was at a ceremonial-type thing like this recently, and I didn't have a speech.  I kept going into my pocket for a speech, but I never wrote one.  But now I got one.  It's here, and I should have had a little water before I got on because my mouth's dry.  But I thank you and I just have to say...First, I don't know where he is in the house, I can't pick him out, but I got to thank him.  I'm completely indebted to Marty Brest who directed the picture and who had such great love for this character I played.  And that love is what he communicated to me every day, so I thank you, Marty, for that.  I thank Bo Goldman, who wrote such a complicated, interesting, funny guy that could be and would be any actor's dream part.  That part was so great.  I thank Chris O'Donnell, my co-star in this.  He made every day a pleasure for me.  And I thank the wonderful support of cast and crew, of course.  I also want to thank Tom Pollock and Casey Silver at Universal Pictures, and my agent Rick Nicita who urged me to do this part and actually threatened me if I didn't do it, 'cause I didn't want to do the part for some reason.  Ira Lewis, my friend and my colleague, who helped me, Ira Lewis.  And The Associated Blind for their generous support to me.If you'll indulge me for a minute—I'm just not used to this, so I had to write this down.  I had this thought, and I thought if I ever got up here I would say it.  I've been very lucky.  I found desire for what I do early in my life and I'm lucky because I had people who encouraged that desire, from Lee Strasberg, to my great friend and mentor Charlie Laughton, to the great writers and filmmakers that I've been fortunate enough to work with.  Now, recently a young girl came up to me.  I was at a function for the South Bronx, which is where I'm from.  And she said that I had encouraged her, and that's not necessarily by my work but just by the fact that we came from the same place.  And I just can't forget that girl, and I can't forget the kids out there who may be thinking tonight that if he can do it, I can do it.  So this is really a proud and hopeful moment for me, because I want to thank the Academy for giving us a gift of encouragement.  And this is a gift, a great gift to me.  I thank you all, really.  Thank you.", Al Pacino, 1992 (65th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Philadelphia,"Here's what I know.  I could not be standing here without that undying love that was just sung about by, not Bruce [Springsteen], but Neil Young.  And I have that in a lover that is so close to fine, we should all be able to experience such heaven right here on earth.  I know also that, I should not be doing this, I should not be here, but I am because of the union of such filmmakers as Ed Saxon, Ron Nyswaner, Kristi Zea, Tak Fujimoto, Jonathan Demme -- who seems to have these [referring to the Oscar] attached to his limbs for every actor that works with him of late.  And a cast that includes Antonio Banderas, who, second to my lover, is the only person I would trade for.  And a cast that includes many other people, but the actor who really put his film image at risk, and shone because of his integrity, Mr. Denzel Washington, who I really must share this with.I would not be standing here if it weren't for two very important men in my life, so... two that I haven't spoken with in awhile, but I had the pleasure of just the other evening.  Mr. Rawley Farnsworth, who was my high school drama teacher, who taught me to act well the part, there all the glory lies. And one of my classmates under Mr. Farnsworth, Mr. John Gilkerson.  I mention their names because they are two of the finest gay Americans, two wonderful men that I had the good fortune to be associated with, to fall under their inspiration at such a young age.  I wish my babies could have the same sort of teacher, the same sort of friends.And there lies my dilemma here tonight.  I know that my work in this case is magnified by the fact that the streets of heaven are too crowded with angels. We know their names.  They number a thousand for each one of the red ribbons that we wear here tonight.  They finally rest in the warm embrace of the gracious creator of us all.  A healing embrace that cools their fevers, that clears their skin, and allows their eyes to see the simple, self-evident, common sense truth that is made manifest by the benevolent creator of us all and was written down on paper by wise men, tolerant men, in the city of Philadelphia two hundred years ago.  God bless you all.  God have mercy on us all.  And God bless America.", Tom Hanks, 1993 (66th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Forrest Gump,"Thank you.  I'm standing here in lieu of my fellow nominees who are just as deserving, if not more so, of this moment.  I'm standing here because of an army of people who over the course of a back-breaking schedule that was set by Bob Zemeckis -- who worked much harder than I did and had much more at risk if our efforts were not successful.  I'm empowered to stand here thanks to the ensemble of actors, men and women who I shared the screen with, who in ways that they will never understand made me a better actor.  And I am standing here because the woman I share my life with has taught me and demonstrates for me every day just what love is.I -- man, I feel as though I'm standing on magic legs in a special effects process shot that is too unbelievable to imagine and far too costly to make a reality.  But here is my mark, and there is where I'm supposed to look.  And believe me, the power and the pleasure and the emotion of this moment is a constant the speed of light.  It will never be diminished, nor will my appreciation and the meaning between two simple words that I can only offer you here:  Thank you.  God bless you in this room and God bless you all around the world.", Tom Hanks, 1994 (67th) Academy Awards

 Actor in a Leading Role, Shine,"I want to thank the members of the Academy.  I'd also like to thank every Australian actor and theater colleague I've ever worked with.  There's a game you can play where you create a dinner party where you can invite guests from any time in history, real or fictional.  The Academy has honored me by choosing to seat me as ""David Helfgott"" at a table with ""Larry Flynt"" and ""Count Laszlo de Almásy"" and ""Karl Childers"" and ""Jerry Maguire.""  I can't quite imagine where the conversation might head that night, but it has really enriched me as an actor to be seated at that table.I want to thank Scott Hicks and all of the ""Shine"" team for giving me the chance to have a glimpse of the bird of paradise.  Scott, thank you.  My darling wife Jane, I wouldn't be standing here without you, and to Merle and John, my mum and stepdad in Queensland.  And to the unstoppable David Helfgott.  The front of my script said that this story was inspired by the events of your life.  You truly are an inspiration.  And to those people who say it's a circus, then with your celebration of life you show me that the circus is a place of daring and risk-taking and working without a safety net and giving us your personal poetry.

We had like, I don't know, I've had a sinking feeling all night right up till here.  Something about it.  We had Jim Brooks, Maria Kavanaugh, Kristi Zea, Bridget Johnson, Peter Andros*, Laura Ziskin, so many producers on the picture I can't remember them all.  Mr. Andrus and Mr. Brooks wrote the script, cast Miss Hunt, Mr. Kinnear, Cuba Gooding, Skeet Ulrich, Shirley Knight -- I know Gil Cates is starting to sweat back there, now isn't he, Bill, isn't he?  Go ahead with it?  Alright.  Sure. I would like to thank everybody here tonight for looking so good.  I'd like to dedicate this to Miles Davis, Robert Mitchum, Shorty Smith, Joe Vitrano*, Ray Kramer, Rupert Crosse, J.T. Walsh and Luana Anders.  They're not here anymore, but they're in my heart.

I am not able to express all my gratitude, because now, my body is in tumult because it is a colossal moment of joy so everything is really in a way that I cannot express.  I would like to be Jupiter! And kidnap everybody and lie down in the firmament making love to everybody, because I don't know how to express.  It's a question of love. You are really -- this is a mountain of snow, so delicate, the suavity and the kindness, it is something I cannot forget, from the bottom of my heart.  And thank you for the Academy Awards for the, who really loved the movie.  Thank you to all in Italy, for the Italian cinema, grazie al Italia who made me.  I am really, I owe to them all my, if I did something good.  So grazie al Italia e grazie al America, land of the lot of things here. Thank you very much.  And I hope, really I don't deserve this, but I hope to win some other Oscars!  Thank you!  Thank you very much!  Thank you!", Roberto Benigni, 1998 (71st) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, American Beauty,"This is the highlight of my day.  I hope it is not all downhill from here.  I first have to say that I would like to dedicate this to the man who inspired my performance.  A man who has been my friend and my mentor, and since my father died, a little bit like my father, whose performance in ""The Apartment"" stands as one of the finest we've ever had.  Jack Lemmon, wherever you are, thank you, thank you, thank you.To my friends, for pointing out my worst qualities.  I know you do it because you love me.  And that's why I loved playing ""Lester,"" because we got to see all of his worst qualities and we still grew to love him.  This movie to me is all about how any single act from any single person put out of context is damnable.  But the joy of this movie is that it is real beauty.  We found real beauty in this extraordinary script by Sam Mendes -- by Alan Ball.  It feels like he wrote it though, doesn't it?I am very proud to be an actor, and I have tried very hard to protect my work; and I am stunned and a bit speechless.  And Dianne, thank you for teaching me about caring about the right things, and I love you.  And Mother, I don't care what they say about bringing you to award shows.  I will always bring you to award shows because I'm proud of you and I love you.  And thank you, thank you, thank you.", Kevin Spacey, 1999 (72nd) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Gladiator,"Whew!  My grandfather's name was Stan Wemyss.  He was a cinematographer in the second World War.  My uncle David, David William Crowe, he died last year at the age of sixty-six.  I'd like to thank the Academy for something which is pretty surprising and dedicate it to two men who still continue to inspire me. I'd also like to thank my mum and dad, who I just don't thank enough, I suppose.And an incredible cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, Ralf Moeller, Spencer Treat Clark, the magnificent Richard Harris, the late Oliver Reed, Tomas Arana, Tommy Flanagan, Derek Jacobi and everybody else. DreamWorks, a great company and a vital and andrenalized contributor to the art form.  To Doug Wick, David Franzoni, Bruno Lustig and Terry Needham, and a very brave crew collected from twenty-two different countries around the world.  To the people that work for me, who work with me, my personal cavalry: George Freeman, Alan Hergott, Larry Witzer, Shirley Pearce, Robin Baum, Mark Dumbrell.  But really folks, you know, I owe this to one bloke and his name is Ridley Scott.  You know, when you grow up in the suburbs of Sydney or Auckland, or Newcastle like Ridley or Jamie Bell, or the suburbs of anywhere, you know, a dream like this seems kind of vaguely ludicrous and completely unattainable.  But this moment is directly connected to those childhood imagining[s]. And for anybody who's on the down side of advantage and relying purely on courage, it's possible.  Thanks very much.", Russell Crowe, 2000 (73rd) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Training Day,"Two birds in one night, huh?  Oh, God is good.  God is great.  God is great. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you all.  Forty years I've been chasing Sidney [Poitier], they finally give it to me, what'd  they do?  They give it to him the same night.  I'll always be chasing you, Sidney.  I'll always be following in your footsteps.  There's nothing I would rather do, sir.  Nothing I would rather do.  God bless you.  God bless you.I want to thank the Academy.  You know, when I was in college first starting out as an actor, they asked each one of us what we wanted to do.  I said I want to be the best actor in the world.  All the students in the classroom looked at me like I was a nut.  Life has taught me to just try and be the best that I can be, and I thank the Academy for saying to me that on this given night I was the best that I could be.  I want to thank Warner Bros. and Alan Horn and Lorenzo di Bonaventura for supporting this film.  And Antoine Fuqua, a brilliant young filmmaker, African-American filmmaker.  I don't know where you are, Antoine, love you.  Ethan Hawke, my partner in crime.  So many people, I can't even remember everybody, lawyers, doctors, agents...  My beautiful agent, Ed Limato.  We've been together for so many years.  Hometown boy from Mount Vernon.  My beautiful wife.  I love you so much.  You put up with me, in spite of myself.  And my beautiful children at home.  I told you if I lost tonight I would come home and we'd celebrate and if I won tonight I would come home and we'd celebrate.  Well, I'm coming home, we're celebrating.

 Actor in a Leading Role, The Pianist,"[Kisses presenter Halle Berry]  I bet they didn't tell you that was in the gift bag.Oh my God.  Thank you.  Thank you, really.  Oh my goodness.  It doesn't come out in slow motion, but it doesn't really ring a bell--the name.  I didn't know my name when you said that.  This Adrien?  Okay.I haven't really written a speech because every time I wrote a speech for the past one of these things I didn't win.  But, you know, there comes a time in life when everything seems to make sense and this is not one of those times. What I do know, though, is that I've never felt this much love and encouragement from my peers and from people I admire and from complete strangers. And it means a great deal to me.  And if it weren't for the insomnia and those sudden panic attacks, this has been an amazing, amazing journey.I have to thank--they're already flashing time's up--I have to thank my mother and father, most importantly, for all the creativity and the encouragement.  And they've been just... real strength. They've given me a great deal of strength.What can I say?  This film would not be possible without the blueprint provided by Wladyslaw Szpilman.  And this is a tribute to his survival.  I'd like to thank Roman Polanski for the role of a lifetime.  And for those of you who have seen the film and sat through the credits, you know there are just too many people to thank individually.  I would not be here without all their efforts.  And I thank them.  And everyone worked extremely hard to make this film.  And I have to thank Focus Features for getting us out there.  To my longtime friend, manager, agent, consigliere, Joanne Colonna.  Everybody at The Firm, PMK/HBH.  And you know...[music plays].  Wait one second.  One second, please, one second.  Cut it out, cut it out.  I get one shot at this. I'm sorry.  I didn't say more than five names I don't think, but...This is, you know, it fills me with great joy, but I am also filled with a lot of sadness tonight because I'm accepting an award at such a strange time. And, you know, my experiences in making this film made me very aware of the sadness and the dehumanization of people at times of war, and the repercussions of war.  And whomever you believe in, if it's God or Allah, may He watch over you.  And let's pray for a peaceful and swift resolution.  Thank you.  And I have a friend from Queens who's a soldier in Kuwait right now, Tommy Zarabinski.  And I hope you and your boys make it back real soon.  God bless you, guys.  I love you.  Thank you very much.", Adrien Brody, 2002 (75th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Mystic River,"Thank you.  If there's one thing that actors know--other than that there weren't any WMDs--it's that there is no such thing as ""best"" in acting.  And that's proven by these great actors that I was nominated with, as well as the Giamattis, Cages, Downey Jrs., Nicholsons, etc., that were not nominated.  We know how great all of you were.  My daughter Dylan and son Hopper find it presumptuous and embarrassing to write a speech, and so I'm gonna give it a go without.  God, I really thank Clint Eastwood professionally and humanly for coming into my life.  The great, great cast that I had to work with, my friends.  Where do you go?  Dennis Lehane, Brian Helgeland.  Ma.  Dad.  Robin, for being an undying emotional inspiration on this roller coaster I'm learning to enjoy.  Thank you all very much.", Sean Penn, 2003 (76th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Ray,"Wow. I guess we got to do it again. [Sings:] ""Oooh!""  [Audience repeats back.]  [Sings:] ""Aaah!""  [Audience repeats back.]  Yeah, you're ready. That's the Ray Charles.  Give it up for Ray Charles and his beautiful legacy. And thank you, Ray Charles, for living.I got so many people to thank tonight. And first I'm going to start it out with Taylor Hackford. Taylor, you took a chance, man.  I mean that love for Ray Charles was deep down in the earth somewhere and you opened it up. And it's cracked open and it's spilling, and everybody's drowning in this love.  I thank you for taking a chance on this film. And thank you for waiting fifteen years to get me to do it.  I want to thank you; I want to thank Crusader.I want to thank my agents. I want to thank Rick Kurtzman.  I want to thank Kim Hodgert. I want to thank Steve Smooke. I want to thank my managers Jaime King and Marcus King. Let's live this African-American dream. It's beautiful. I'm glad I'm with you and I ain't never leaving you. So I love you.I got a chance to meet a whole lot of people, experiencing this. And other people I want to thank, I want to thank my sister; four foot eleven of nothing but pure love.  I want to thank my daughter for telling me just before I got up here, ""If you don't win, Dad, you're still good.""I see Oprah and I see Halle and I just want to say your names.  I want to talk to you later.  Both of you.  Because Oprah allowed me to meet somebody by the name of Sidney Poitier. And Sidney Poitier said [mimicking his voice], ""I saw you once.  And I looked in your eyes and there was a connection.""  And he says, ""I give to you responsibility.""  So I'm taking that responsibility tonight.  And thank you, Sidney.This is probably going to be the toughest part of this speech.  My daughter shares my grandmother's name:  Marie.  My grandmother's name is Estelle Marie Talley.  And she's not here tonight.  And this is going to be the toughest part.  But she was my first acting teacher.  She told me, ""Stand up straight. Put your shoulders back.  Act like you got some sense.""  We would go places and I would wild out, and she says, ""Act like you've been somewhere.""  And then when I would act the fool, she would beat me.  She would whup me.  And she could get an Oscar for the way she whupped me because she was great at it. And after she whipped me, she would talk to me and tell me why she whipped me, said, ""I want you to be a southern gentleman.""  And she still talks to me now; only now she talks to me in my dreams.  And I can't wait to go to sleep tonight because we got a lot to talk about. I love you.", Jamie Foxx, 2004 (77th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Capote,"Wow, I'm in a category with some great, great, great actors.  Fantastic actors.  And I'm overwhelmed, I'm really overwhelmed.  I'd like to thank Bill Vince and Caroline Baron and Danny Rosett, the film wouldn't have happened without them.  I'd like to thank Sarah Fargo.  I'd like to thank Sara Murphy. I'd like to thank Emily Ziff.  My friends, my friends, my friends.  I'd like to thank Bennett Miller and Danny Futterman, who I love, I love, I love, I love, I love.

And I'd like to thank Tom Bernard and Michael Barker, thank you so much.And my mom's name is Marilyn O'Connor, and she's here tonight.  And I'd like if you see her tonight to congratulate her, because she brought up four kids alone and she deserves a congratulations for that.  Ah, we're at the party, ma, you know?  And she took me to my first play and she stayed up with me and watched the NCAA final four, and my passions, her passions became my passions. And, you know, be proud, mom, because I'm proud of you and we're here tonight and it's so good.   Thank you.", Philip Seymour Hoffman, 2005 (78th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, The Last King of Scotland,"Thank you.  Thank you.  Just a second, just a second.  Okay.  Take it [in], okay.  I wrote something down because I thought if it would happen I would be a little overwhelmed and I am.  So, okay.When I was a kid the only way that I saw movies was from the backseat of my family's car at the drive-in, and it wasn't my reality to think I would be acting in movies.  So receiving this honor tonight tells me that it's possible, it is possible for a kid from east Texas, raised in South Central L.A., in Carson, who believes in his dreams, commits himself to them with his heart, to touch them and to have them happen.  Because when I first started acting, it was because of my desire to connect to everyone, to that thing inside each of us, that light that I believe exists in all of us.  Because acting for me is about believing in that connection; and it's a connection so strong, it's a connection so deep that we feel it and through our combined belief we can create a new reality.So I want to thank my fellow believers in ""The Last King of Scotland.""  I want to thank Peter, Jeremy, Andrea, Lisa, Charles, Kevin, James McAvoy, Kerry, Stephen, Fox, DNA, Channel Four.  I want to thank the people of Uganda, who helped this film have a spirit.  And finally, I want to thank my mom and my dad; I want to thank my wife Keisha, my children, my ancestors who continue to guide my steps, and God, God who believes in us all and who's given me this moment in this lifetime that I will hopefully carry to the end of my lifetime into the next lifetime.

 Actor in a Leading Role, There Will Be Blood,"That's the closest I'll ever come to getting a knighthood, so thank you.  My deepest thanks to the members of the Academy for whacking me with the handsomest bludgeon in town.I'm looking at this gorgeous thing that you've given me and I'm thinking back to the first devilish whisper of an idea that came to him and everything since and it seems to me that this sprang like a golden sapling out of the mad, beautiful head of Paul Thomas Anderson.  I wish my son and my partner, HW Plainview, were up here with me, the mighty Dillon Freasier.  So many people to thank.  One amongst them would be Mrs. Plainview, down there, the enchantingly optimistic, open-minded and beautiful Rebecca Miller.  I hope that all those to whom I owe and to whom I feel the deepest gratitude will forgive me if I say just simply:  Thank you, Paul.I've been thinking a lot about fathers and sons in the course of this, and I'd like to accept this in the memory of my grandfather, Michael Balcon; my father, Cecil Day Lewis; and my three fine boys, Gabriel, Ronan and Cashel. Thank you very much indeed.  Thank you.", Daniel Day-Lewis, 2007 (80th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Milk,"Thank you.  Thank you.  You commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns!  I did not expect this, but I, and I want it to be very clear that I do know how hard I make it to appreciate me, often.  But I am touched by the appreciation and I hoped for it enough that I did want to scribble down so I had the names, in case you were commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns.  And so I want to thank my best friend, Sata Matsuzawa*.  My circle of long-time support:  Mara, Bryan, Barry and Bob.  The great Cleve Jones.  Our wonderful writer, Lance Black. Producers Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks.  And particularly, as all us actors know, our director either has the patience, talent and restraint to grant us a voice or they don't, and it goes from the beginning of the meeting through the cutting room.  And there is no finer hands to be in than Gus Van Sant.And finally, for those--two last finallies.  For those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight, I think that it is a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame and the shame in their grandchildren's eyes if they continue that way of support.  We've got to have equal rights for everyone.  And there are, and there are these last two things.  I'm very, very proud to live in a country that is willing to elect an elegant man president and a country who, for all its toughness, creates courageous artists, and this is in great due respect to all the nominees, but courageous artists who, despite a sensitivity that sometimes has brought enormous challenge, Mickey Rourke rises again and he is my brother.

 Actor in a Leading Role, Crazy Heart,"Oh!  Thank you, Academy members!  Mom and Dad, yeah, look!  Whoo!  Thank you, Mom and Dad, for turning me on to such a groovy profession.  Oh, my dad, my mom, they loved show biz so much.  I remember my mom getting all of us kids to entertain at her parties, you know, my dad sitting me on his bed and teaching me all of the basics of acting for a role in ""Sea Hunt.""  They loved show biz so much and I feel an extension of them, you know, this is honoring them as much as it is me.I wanna thank Scott Cooper, our wonderful director, for his knowledge of film and country music, and for his ability to instill self-confidence in his actors.  I thank you for that, Scott.  Where are you?  Raise your hand, man. Yeah!  Scotty!  Thank you for that, Scott man!  And thank you for assembling such a wonderful cast.  Maggie Gyllenhaal, Colin, wherever he is backstage, and Bobby Duvall.  So wonderful, you guys brought your heart and soul.  I want to thank Barry Markowitz, our wonderful DP, did such a brilliant job.  Judy Cairo, our producer, and Fox Searchlight, our wonderful distributor.  Thank you, guys, for keeping us all together and for making it all happen.  T Bone Burnett and Stephen Bruton, for bringing all of that great music and those wonderful musicians to the party, man.

 Actor in a Leading Role, The King's Speech,"I have a feeling my career has just peaked.  My deepest thanks to the Academy.  I'm afraid I have to warn you that I'm experiencing stirrings, somewhere in the upper abdominals, which are threatening to form themselves into dance moves which, joyous as they may be for me, it would be extremely problematic if they make it to my legs before I get offstage.  So I'm going to do my best to be brief with my gratitude.First, for being on this extraordinary list of fellow nominees; something quite formidable and possibly the greatest honor of this.  All the crew and my fellow cast members, those who are not here and those who are.  Geoffrey, Helena, and Guy, whose virtuosity made it very, very difficult for me to be as bad as I was planning to be.  And David Seidler, whose own struggles have given so many people the benefit of his very beautiful voice, and Tom Hooper, for the immense courage and clear sightedness with which he interpreted that. The men who finessed this to the screen:  Gareth, Emile, Iain, Xavier, and of course Harvey, who first took me on twenty years ago when I was a mere child sensation.And all the people who have been rooting for me back home.  Also Jessica Kolstad, my friend, Paul Lyon-Maris and Chris Andrews, for bearing with me through some of the less fortunate moments as well as the good ones.  And my very fortunate friendship with Tom Ford who, to whom I owe a very big piece of this.  And to the Anglo-Italian-American-Canadian axis which makes up my family.  And Livia, for putting up with my fleeting delusions of royalty and who I hold responsible for this, and for really everything that's good that's happened since I met her.  Now, if you'll all excuse me I have some impulses I have to tend to backstage.  Thank you very much [unintelligible].", Colin Firth, 2010 (83rd) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, The Artist,"Thank you. Ouais! I love your country. Okay. Thank you to the Academy. It's funny because in 1929 it wasn't Billy Crystal but Douglas Fairbanks who hosted the first Oscar ceremony. Tickets cost five dollars and it lasted fifteen minutes. Times have changed. So thank you, Douglas Fairbanks. Yes, Melissa, your grandfather's spirit and joie de vivre inspired me for this role. And so many of you here tonight have inspired me. Thank you, Michel. Thank you for this incredible gift. Thank you, my wonderful partner, Bérénice Bejo. Thank you, the wonderful cast and crew. My wife, I love you. Kisses, Simon, Jules, Chloe.

 Actor in a Leading Role, Lincoln,"I really don't know how any of this happened. I do know that I've received so much more than my fair share of good fortune in my life and I'm so grateful to the Academy for this beautiful honor. It's a strange thing because three years ago, before we decided to do a straight swap, I had actually been committed to play Margaret Thatcher... and Meryl was Steven's first choice for Lincoln. And I'd like to see that version. And Steven didn't have to persuade me to play Lincoln but I had to persuade him that perhaps, if I was going to do it, that ""Lincoln"" shouldn't be a musical.My fellow nominees, my equals, my betters, I'm so proud to have been included as one amongst you. When we got married sixteen years ago – or since we got married sixteen years ago – my wife Rebecca has lived with some very strange men. I mean they were strange as individuals and probably even stranger if taken as a group. But luckily she's the versatile one in the family and she's been the perfect companion to all of them. I'd like to thank Kathy Kennedy, our producer, and through you, Kathy... and through you, our mighty team of co-conspirators. At the apex of that human pyramid there are three men to whom I owe this and a great deal more: Tony Kushner; our beloved skipper Steven Spielberg; and the mysteriously beautiful mind, body and spirit of Abraham Lincoln. For my mother. Thank you so much.", Daniel Day-Lewis, 2012 (85th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Dallas Buyers Club,"Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you to the Academy for this, all six thousand members. Thank you to the other nominees. All these performances were impeccable in my opinion; I didn't see a false note anywhere. I want to thank Jean-Marc Vallée, our director. I want to thank Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner, who I worked with daily.There's a few things, about three things, to my account that I need each day. One of 'em is something to look up to. Another is something to look forward to. And another is someone to chase. Now, first off, I want to thank God, 'cause that's who I look up to. He has graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand. He has shown me that it's a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. In the words of the late Charlie Laughton*, who said, ""When you've got God, you've got a friend. And that friend is you.""To my family, that's who and what I look forward to. To my father, who I know is up there right now with a big pot of gumbo. He's got a lemon meringue pie over there. He's probably in his underwear and he's got a cold can of Miller Lite. And he's dancin' right now. To you, Dad, you taught me what it means to be a man. To my mother who's here tonight, who taught me and my two older brothers – demanded – that we respect ourselves, and what we in turn learned was then we were better able to respect others. Thank you for that, Mama. To my wife Camila and my kids, Levi, Vida and Mr. Stone, the courage and significance you give me every day I go out the door is unparalleled. You are the four people in my life that I want to make the most proud of me. Thank you.And to my hero; that's who I chase. Now, when I was 15 years old I had a very important person in my life come to me and say, ""Who's your hero?"" And I said, I don't know; I gotta think about that. Give me a couple of weeks. I come back two weeks later, this person comes up and says, ""Who's your hero?"" I said, I thought about it. You know who it is? I said, it's me in 10 years. So I turned 25; ten years later that same person comes to me and goes, ""So, are you a hero?"" And I was like, not even close! No, no, no. She said, ""Why?"" I said, because my hero's me at 35. So you see every day, every week, every month and every year of my life, my hero's always 10 years away. I'm never gonna be my hero. I'm not gonna attain that; I know I'm not. And that's just fine with me, because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasin'.So to any of us, whatever those things are: whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to, and whoever it is we're chasin'. To that I say: Amen. To that I say: Alright, alright, alright. To that I say: Just keep livin'. Thank you.", Matthew McConaughey, 2013 (86th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, The Theory of Everything,"Oh my god. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to the Academy. I don't think I'm capable of articulating quite how I feel right now. Please know this, I am fully aware that I am a lucky, lucky man. This, this Oscar... wow!  This Oscar, this belongs to all of those people around the world battling ALS. It belongs to one exceptional family:  Stephen, Jane, Jonathan and the Hawking children. And I will be its custodian. And I will promise you I will look after him – I will polish him; I will answer his beck and call; I will wait on him hand and foot. But I would not be here were it not for an extraordinary troupe of people. My staggering partner in crime, Felicity Jones. My ferocious and yet incredibly kind director, James Marsh. Working Title, Focus, Lisa and Anthony, Nina, and my ingenious team of Dallas, Josh, Gene, Jason, Elan, Carl*, Britney* and Carrie and Pip. Now, finally, please, this is so extraordinary. I just want to thank my family and you, Hannah, my wife. I love you so much. We have a new fella comin' to share our apartment. Thank you.", Eddie Redmayne, 2014 (87th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, The Revenant,"Thank you. Thank you all so very much. Thank you to the Academy. Thank you to all of you in this room. I have to congratulate the other incredible nominees this year for their unbelievable performances. ""The Revenant"" was a product of the tireless efforts of an unbelievable cast and crew I got to work alongside. First off, to my brother in this endeavor, Mr. Tom Hardy. Tom, your fierce talent on screen can only be surpassed by your friendship off screen. To Mr. Alejandro Iñárritu, as the history of cinema unfolds you have forged your way into history these past two years. What an unbelievable talent you are. Thank you to you and Chivo for creating a transcendent cinematic experience for all of us. Thank you to everybody at Fox and New Regency, in particular Arnon Milchan. You were the champion of this endeavor. My entire team.  I have to thank everyone from the very onset of my career. Mr. Caton-Jones, for casting me in my first film. Mr. Scorsese, for teaching me so much about the cinematic art form. To Mr. Rick Yorn, thank you for helping me navigate my way through this industry. And to my parents, none of this would be possible without you. And to my friends, I love you dearly; you know who you are.And lastly, I just want to say this. Making ""The Revenant"" was about man's relationship to the natural world, a world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history. Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow. Climate change is real. It is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations, but who speak for all of humanity. For the indigenous people of the world. For the billions and billions of underprivileged people who will be most affected by this. For our children's children. And for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed. I thank you all for this amazing award tonight. Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted. Thank you so very much.", Leonardo DiCaprio, 2015 (88th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Leading Role, Manchester by the Sea,"That means so much to me, thank you. One of the first people who taught me how to act was Denzel Washington, and I just met him tonight for the first time. Thank you. And to all the other nominees, you did great work. I'm proud to be in your company. You guys are very brave and I admire what you do. I'm only here, really, because of all the talents and goodwill of so many people; they're impossible to name. But most of all Kenneth Lonergan, who made this part, and without this part and without his writing I wouldn't be here for sure. And well, he directed it. Man, I wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say, but I'm just, I'm really proud to be a part of this community in general. I look out at all of you, I have this whole year, and I'm just dumbfounded that I'm included. It means a lot to me. Thank you also to Matt Damon for creating this opportunity. To Mara Buxbaum, for so much. And to Patrick and Boomer, and so many people. Of course my mother and my father, for mostly, usually, believing in me in doing this.

I've lived in America for the longest time and I am deeply grateful to her for the loves and the friendships I have made and the many wonderful gifts it has given me: my home, my livelihood, my family and now Oscar. The movies, such is their power, captivated a young man from South London and gave him a dream. And Douglas Urbanski, my dear, dear friend and brother, you have helped keep that dream alive. Joe Wright, thank you for this [holding out the Oscar]. It only took twenty years for us to work together, but it was well worth the wait. Thank you, Kazu, Lucy, David, for your artistry. Thank you, everyone at Working Title and Universal Focus, for your herculean efforts and support on this film. Thank you, Eric Fellner, Tim Bevan, Lisa Bruce, Anthony McCarten. Dani and her amazing team. And of course, Jim Osborne.I would just like to salute Sir Winston Churchill who has been marvelous company on what can be described as an incredible journey, and my wife Gisele for traveling that road with me and being at my side. Thank you, Alfie, Gully, Charlie, William. My remarkable, remarkable fellow nominees, and my dear friend out there, Denzel. And obviously I'm not gonna win the, uh, you know, the ski. I would like to thank my mother who is older than the Oscar. She is 99 years young next birthday, and she is watching this ceremony from the comfort of her sofa. I say to my mother: Thank you for your love and support. Put the kettle on, I'm bringing Oscar home.", Gary Oldman, 2017 (90th) Academy Awards

What I want to do is say thank you to Darryl Zanuck, to John Ford, to Philip Dunne for the wonderful script, and for the opportunity to play such a wonderful part. I think there's quite a lot of the old timers knocking around that could do justice to some of that and some of you wonderful producers will look at some of these old timers and give 'em a chance. There's a lot of good blood there. I'm very thrilled, ladies and gentlemen, very honored, very grateful for this. And I do want to say that my little friend Barbara Stanwyck has been rehearsing me all week; she's handed me every lamp and statue on the set. So it was alright. Thank you again very, very much.", Donald Crisp, 1941 (14th) Academy Awards

 Actor in a Supporting Role, Miracle on 34th Street,"Whoow!  Now I know there's a Santa Claus.  Oh, you may laugh, ladies and gentlemen.  It's not so easy to be certain, you know.  He's a most elusive little fellow.  He turns up in all sorts of places under all sorts of names and disguises.  First time I ever met him he told me his name was George Seaton.  And wonderfully, George Seaton has his revenge by bringing him to life.  About a year and a half ago he suddenly turned up in Culver City and told me his name was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  That was the day Metro agreed to loan me to Fox to make the picture.  And now I think it's time Santa Claus added a word to his name.  I think he ought to call himself Santa Claus, Incorporated.  Santa Claus, Inc.  Inc.!  For then he would embrace all you wonderful, kind people who have done me the honor of making me stand here tonight.  Thank you, all of you, for making the evening of my life such a happy one.  Thank you.", Edmund Gwenn, 1947 (20th) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Supporting Role, Twelve O'Clock High,"You shouldn't do that much of that. They suggested that if you had anything to say if you were lucky enough to get up here and get one of these wonderful things, you keep it to fifteen seconds, I believe it was. I can think of a lot of things I'd love to say and I couldn't say 'em in fifteen seconds. I would like to say this, because I hear a lot of kidding about what people say when they get one of these, but you do feel grateful to a few people that helped you to. And I would like to say to a man by the name of Darryl Zanuck, who's given me a couple pretty wonderful opportunities, to Henry King, a fine man and a great director, I'm very grateful. And I feel as emotional as the dickens about it. Thank you very much.", Dean Jagger, 1949 (22nd) Academy Awards

And I'm terribly pleased, and if I start thanking everybody then I'll do a one-reeler up here so I better not.

 Actor in a Supporting Role, Spartacus,"Ladies and gentlemen, having been educated in an English school we were taught for at least fifteen years of our lives how to lose gracefully, and I'd been preparing myself for that all afternoon. Now I don't quite know what to say except that obviously, whatever people may think, you can't act by yourself.

But most of all, and this is from the heart, my agent George Morris. Really and truly this man had faith in me that I didn't have myself. I never dreamed I would get that part, but he had faith in me and he kept after it and I got it. Thank you very, very much.", Ed Begley, 1962 (35th) Academy Awards

 Actor in a Supporting Role, Topkapi,"I don't know whether Peter expected this, I certainly didn't. Otherwise I would have been sure to wear black socks. But I'll make this very brief. I'm more excited than if Peter were here himself. He's in England. I'm pretty sure in Europe. Obviously he isn't here; but if he were here, he, I'm sure, would be almost as speechless as me.

 Actor in a Supporting Role, The Fortune Cookie,"Thank you. The other day, as I was falling off my bicycle, I had the following thoughts:  I was given a very juicy part; I was allowed to work with talented, exhilarating and beautiful people; I was given a good deal of money and a great deal of joy.

 Actor in a Supporting Role, The Subject Was Roses,"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the Academy. I didn't think I was gonna be this moved. I must say I'm glad I'm off the hook; it's the first one. And it's not the first time I've been an opening act.There are so many people to thank I really don't know where to begin. I'd like to thank Edgar Lansbury, Ulu Grosbard, Martin Sheen. Of course that wonderful, wonderful actress and great woman, Patricia Neal. And throughout the years I've had the help and encouragement of many people and to them I'm extremely grateful, but I must say that my eternal gratitude will always be reserved for the man who made this moment possible: Frank Gilroy, the author of ""The Subject Was Roses.""

 Actor in a Supporting Role, Ryan's Daughter,"Well, I really, honestly was not expecting to be standing here with Oscar. I really was not.

But I do want to say that I think it's a wonderful choice – for me, I mean. I really am terribly – everything sounds like a cliché, but I'm really, enormously thrilled. I do think competition is rather good, and I've been competing all my life. And I'm very thrilled that I've won this and I shall always remember this moment. Thank you very much indeed.", John Mills, 1970 (43rd) Academy Awards
 Actor in a Supporting Role, The Last Picture Show,"Boy, ain't that purty.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm very grateful to the Academy.  I had a speech all rigged up for this but the more I worked on it the phonier it got, so, I'd like to mention some people that has made this all possible:  Mr. Peter Bogdanovich, the director of ""The Last Picture Show;"" his lovely wife Polly; Mr. John Ford, who had a lot to do with my doing the show; the entire cast and crew; and all of the folks down in Anarene, Texas –  I think they deserve a big mention; last but certainly not least, Columbia Pictures.  Now, if you got a crew like that behind you, you can't be all bad.  And now what I'm about to say probably will stir up a lot of conversation around over the country.  There's something I'd like to leave in everyone's mind throughout the world: This couldn't have happened to a nicer feller.  Thank you.", Ben Johnson, 1971 (44th) Academy Awards

For all those who worked with me on ""The Paper Chase,"" for their great kindness and generosity at the appearance of a mysterious intruder in their midst.  For Gordon Willis, whose extraordinarily dramatic camera work did a great deal to create the character of ""Dr. Kingsfield.""

You know, I've been in show business all of my life and I've loved every minute of it.  And being honored tonight by getting this award proves one thing:  that if you stay in the business long enough and if you can get to be old enough, you get to be new again.  I was very fortunate to work with two fine actors like Walter Matthau and Dick Benjamin, and to be directed by Herb Ross, and a script by Neil Simon, and with a great producer like Ray Stark, and for a beautiful studio like MGM.  And being surrounded by all that talent was a great break for a newcomer like myself.  And the last picture I made was thirty-seven years ago, and making ""The Sunshine Boys"" was so exciting I've decided that I'm gonna make a picture every thirty-seven years. Thank you.", George Burns, 1975 (48th) Academy Awards

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and a few enemies...I don't think there is anyone aware—or unaware, rather—in Hollywood or the rest of the world tonight that this is the 60th anniversary of these Academy Awards.  And I just realized myself the other day that my first, one and only attendance was thirty years ago.  Patience truly is a virtue.  But in winning this award it creates a certain dilemma, because I had decided if I had the good fortune to win that I would give it to my wife, who deserves it.  But this evening I discovered  backstage that they're worth fifteen thousand dollars...and now I'm not so sure.  Cherie, I'm only kidding, it's yours.  But if such a thing as a wish accompanied this award mine would be that we ended the writers' strike.  And I thank you all sincerely.", Sean Connery, 1987 (60th) Academy Awards

I share this with you.  I would like to thank John Cleese for writing this brilliant script, for his generosity, for his friendship.  To my fellow actors, Michael Palin, Jamie Lee Curtis.  To Jonathan Benson.  To Charlie Crichton, who at seventy-seven proves that even with twenty or twenty-five years off there's no such thing as growing old when you've got a dream.  He's the best.

 Actor in a Supporting Role, City Slickers,"Billy Crystal, [laughs] I crap bigger than him.  You know, there are times when you reach a certain age plateau where the producers say, they talk about you and they say, ""Well, what do you think?  Can we risk it?  Can we do it? Can we use him?""  The other guy says, ""I don't know, let's look at some younger ones.  We can make them look older, but this one, you know, it's kind of difficult.""  They forget, they forget to ask that you go out there and you do all these…things.  Like for instance, you know, [leaves podium] you go out there, you do these one-arm push-ups.  [Does three one-arm push-ups on stage; returns to podium.]  That's nothing, really.  As far as the two-handed push-ups are concerned, you can do that all night and it doesn't make any difference whether she's there or not.  And besides, it's a hell of a lot less expensive.Wow.  You know, a long time ago in 1949, first picture, 1949, first film, I'd been shooting about two weeks and the producer came to me and he said, ""Jack"" – my name at that time was Vladimir, but he called me Jack.

The person who pulls the strings, the person who manipulates, who hovers over us, who gives us life and breath.  For me ""Keyser Soze"" is Bryan Singer, the director of this film.  And I thank him for his friendship, and for giving me an extraordinary part, and for making me a better actor than I ever thought I could be.  I've dreamed of a moment like this my whole life.  I thank my manager Joanne, my agent Brian Gersh.  And on a personal note to my mother, I'm so proud that you can be here tonight. Thank you so much -- [applause].

 Actor in a Supporting Role, The Cider House Rules,"Thank you, thank you.  I was looking [gesturing to the monitor], watching all the others, and thinking back when I saw the performances and I was thinking of how the Academy changed ""The winner is..."" to ""The Oscar goes to..."".   And if ever there was a category where the Oscar goes to someone without there being a winner, it's this one.  Because I do not feel like being the winner. You have Michael, who I'd never heard of quite frankly, who is astonishing. You have Jude, who is going to be a big star no matter what happens.  You have Tom, who if you had won this your pot price would have gone down so fast. Have you any idea what supporting actors get paid?  And we only get one motorhome, a small one.  And Haley Osment, what an astonishing... where is he? There he is.  Haley, when I saw you I thought, well that's me out of it.  So really, I'm basically up here, guys, to represent you as what I hope you will all be, a survivor.I want to -- I've got to hurry up or they...

 Actor in a Supporting Role, Syriana,"Wow.  Wow.  Alright, so I'm not winning Director.  It's a funny thing about winning an Academy Award, this will always be sort of synonymous with your name from here on in.  It will be:  Oscar winner George Clooney, Sexiest Man Alive 1997, Batman, died today in a freak accident....Listen, I don't quite know how you compare art.  You look at these performances this year, of these actors, and unless we all did the same role—everybody put on a bat suit, we'll all try that—unless we all did the same role, I don't know how you compare it.  They are stellar performances and wonderful work, and I'm honored, truly honored to be up here.And finally, I would say that, you know, we are a little bit out of touch in Hollywood every once in a while, I think.  It's probably a good thing.  We're the ones who talked about AIDS when it was just being whispered, and we talked about civil rights when it wasn't really popular.  And we, you know, we bring up subjects, we are the ones—this Academy, this group of people gave Hattie McDaniel an Oscar in 1939 when blacks were still sitting in the backs of theaters.  I'm proud to be a part of this Academy, proud to be part of this community, and proud to be out of touch.  And I thank you so much for this.", George Clooney, 2005 (78th) Academy Awards

It's handwritten, it's short.More than anything I am deeply moved by the open-hearted appreciation our small film has received, which in these fragmented times speaks so openly of the possibility of innocence, growth and connection. Acting for me has always been and always will be a team sport. I cannot work at all unless I feel a spirit of unity around me. So my main sense of gratitude goes to the entire cast and crew and production team of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" for creating the same sense of joy and trust and community that the film speaks about.I'd like to thank the Academy, Fox Searchlight, my wife Suzanne, my sons Adam, Matthew and Tony for their endless support.

 Actor in a Supporting Role, Inglourious Basterds,"Oscar and Penélope, that's an über bingo.I always wanted to discover some new continent and I thought I had to go this way.   And then I was introduced to Quentin Tarantino who was putting together an expedition that was equipped by Harvey Weinstein and Lawrence Bender and David Linde.  And he put this script in front of me and he said, ""This is where we're going, but we're going the other way.""  So Brad Pitt helped me on board and Diane Kruger was there.  And Mélanie Laurent and Denis Menochet and Bob Richardson, Sally Menke, and Adam Schweitzer and Lisa Kasteler.  And everybody helped me find a place.  Universal and The Weinstein Company and ICM.  And Quentin, with his unorthodox methods of navigation, this fearless explorer took this ship across and brought it in with flying colors.  And that's why I'm here.

So for me to have the chance to work with, I think, one of the greatest storytellers of our time, Steven Spielberg, has just been such an honor.

This is, this is going to be a great evening to remember. We've had some very exciting messages and some very exciting speeches. It should make us all very proud to belong to this great and fascinating industry. Praise from our government and our armed forces and from abroad from our allies for work we have done should make us determined to carry on. We have somehow brought very wide horizons into this room tonight. Anything that I have to say now, which is practically unprepared... [camera cuts]As for the nominations, I've always felt that to be nominated simply means that you've had the great good luck to be entrusted with one of the best assignments of the current year, and that's a cause for rejoicing in itself. And there isn't a single good craftsman in this industry who if given such an opportunity can't be counted on to measure up to it.  Why do we all long to win the award? It's no question of superiority because we're comparing different excellences and they're varied in their nature and they can't be fairly compared. There's no rivalry in this room tonight.

 Actress, To Each His Own,"Since I value highly the profession which has instructed me, rewarded me, and permitted me my share of the world's work, it will understand and forgive me, I know, for the very great pride I feel in receiving this symbol of its approbation, one of the Awards of Merit, for my part in this past year, what has been done.  But even in this wonderful moment my common sense reminds me quite clearly that most of the work that went into earning this award was not done by Olivia de Havilland at all, but by a big team of other people who, if justice were really to prevail, would be standing up here beside me now.  When I think of the writer who created ""Jody Norris,"" and how much of her sprang from the heart and mind of the director. When I remember the businessmen who found and managed the money which produced her and distributed her.  And how she grew under the talents and skills of the technicians: the cameraman, the makeup man, the hairdresser, the costumer. And then I think how much the musicians did for her.

Yes, yes, I think my great thrill was when ""Katie"" was voted into that class.  Course, we all know there wouldn't have been any ""Katie"" if it hadn't have been beautifully written and directed and photographed and... and magnificently produced by Mr. Dore Schary.

So I would like to thank my co-producer Ray Stark for waiting till I grew up. And Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, for giving me such a great score to sing. And Isobel Lennart, for writing such a terrific character. And all the Hollywood people who made our show into a movie: Herb Ross, and my dear Harry Stradling who I haven't let go since, and my dear friend and director, William Wyler. Wow.

And all I can say is I've loved being hated by you.  I'd like to thank Fred Roos for remembering me, Milos Forman for choosing me, Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz for taking a chance and giving me a chance, and Jack Nicholson and a cast of actors whose professionalism, humor and capacity for getting into their roles made being in a mental institution like being in a mental institution.

 Actress in a Leading Role, Coming Home,"[Speaking simultaniously in sign language:]  I'm so happy.  I wanted to win very much because I'm so proud of ""Coming Home,"" and I want many people to see the movie.  I'm signing part of what I'm saying tonight because, while we were making the movie, we all became more aware of the problems of the handicapped. Over 14 million people are deaf.  They are the invisible handicapped and can't share this evening, so this is my way of acknowledging them.  [End sign language.]I'm so proud and grateful.  It's been almost eight years.  This film, ""Coming Home,"" was born in Santa Monica where we live, in the cramped offices of the Indochina Peace Campaign, as a lot of us whose lives have been bound up with the war sat on the floor.  And some of them were veterans.  I thank, I thank all of them.  One of them was my husband, Tom Hayden; one of them was Bruce Gilbert, who has become my partner and is the associate producer of ""Coming Home.""I want to thank Waldo Salt, the first – how do you...?  Heavy.  The first industry heavy who stuck his neck out and believed in the project.  In fact he believed so much in it that he worked for two years for nothing.  And he lead us to Jerry Hellman, our producer, who fought for us.  And I want to thank you, Jerry, very much.  And I want to thank Haskell Wexler who photographed it so sensitively and Bob Jones who came through in the pinch.  And I want to thank Hal Ashby; you're not here, Hal, but I want to thank you for your taste and for your courage, for your ability with the scissors.  And I want to thank Penny Milford and Bobby Carradine and Bruce Dern and my pal Jon Voight, and Mike Medavoy and Eric Pleskow and Arthur Krim and Marcia Nasatir for getting us the money to make it.And finally I want to thank my children, Troy and Vanessa, for being understanding and forgiving me my absences.  And again my husband, who helped me believe that besides being entertaining movies can inspire and teach and even be healing.  Thank you, all of you.  Thank the Academy very much.", Jane Fonda, 1978 (51st) Academy Awards
 Actress in a Leading Role, Norma Rae,"Oh, I'm gonna be the one to cry tonight, I'll tell you right now.  They said this couldn't be done.""Norma Rae"" was a real gift to me.  It was given to me by Laddie and Jay and Gareth of the old Fox.  It was given to me by Alex Rose and Tamara Asseyev, who fought very hard to get it made.  It was given to me by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr.  And it truly was a gift, every single word.  It was given to me by John Alonzo, who followed me around with a camera and never hoped to shine himself, just gave it all to me.  It was given to me by the actors, especially Beau Bridges and Ron Leibman, whose real craft and talent and love and support is why I'm here.And mostly it was given to me because of Marty Ritt.  Marty Ritt is ""Norma Rae.""  He has fought all his life to put on films that are courageous, that say things, that are part of him that he feels should be said, that have the box-office potential of seventy-five cents, sometimes less.  And I thank him for that.  He's taught me a lot.  And the best gift that Marty gave me was that he let me feel all the time that I was doing it myself, and I know that I didn't.And on a personal note, I'd like to thank my mother and my sister for holding me together and just plain old holding me.  And my kids, Peter and Eli, for being my constant inspiration, and no matter how many awards I win, if it weren't them I wouldn't be worth a damn.

And I want to thank Loretta Lynn, and my wonderful director Michael Apted, and Tommy Lee Jones—my Doolittle—and Beverly D'Angelo, and Bob Larson, and Sean Daniel, and Bernie Schwartz, and Michael Chinich, and Tom Rickman, and Joe Tompkins, and Pam Wise.  And the lady who gave me all that hair, Lorraine Roberson.  And my wonderful husband Jack.  And all the cast and crew that worked on ""Coal Miner's Daughter.""  I share this with you and I love you.

 Actress in a Leading Role, Sophie's Choice,"Oh, boy!  No matter how much you try to imagine what this is like, it's just so incredibly thrilling, right down to your toes.  I have a lot of people to thank and I'm going to be one of those people that tries to mention a lot of names because I know just two seconds ago my mother and father went completely berserk and I'd like to give some other mothers and fathers that opportunity.I'd like to thank William Styron for creating this beautiful character and Alan Pakula for bringing it to the stage and allowing me to play it.  I would like to thank Marty Starger and ITC for finding the financing for it.  Nestor Almendros, the great cinematographer.  Albert Wolsky, wonderful costumer.

 Actress in a Leading Role, Terms of Endearment,"I'm gonna cry because this show has been as long as my career.  I have wondered for twenty-six years what this would feel like.  Thank you so much for terminating the suspense.  Oh my, I am nervous.I'm not going to thank everybody I've ever met in my entire life -- although, with the way my mind has been going lately probably everybody I've ever met in my entire life and in the other life I might have had had something to do with this.  You know, if ""Terms of Endearment"" had happened to me five years ago, I think I would have called it a thrilling, commercial, artistic accident.  But I don't believe that anymore.  I don't believe there's any such thing as accident.  I think that we all manifest what we want and what we need.  I don't think there's any difference really between what you feel you have to do in your heart and success.  They're inseparable.Jim Brooks deeply wanted to make a film about the defects and imperfections and foibles of people in a humorous and loving way.  And he had such passion. It was unbelievable to watch.  He's being very modest with himself tonight. It was unbelievable.  His sense of truth was so accurate that he overwhelmed his own insecurities, and Paramount's.  I guess we all did the same thing.I have wanted to work with the comic chemistry of Jack Nicholson since his chicken salad sandwich scene in ""Easy Pieces.""  And to have him in bed was such middle-aged joy.  I wanted to work with the turbulent brilliance of Debra Winger.  She literally inhabited the character so thoroughly that I thought for four months I had two daughters.But in the end just let me say one thing.  Films and life are like clay waiting for us to mold it.  And when you trust your own insides, and that becomes achievement, it's a kind of a principle that seems to me is at work with everyone.  God bless that principle.  God bless that potential that we all have for making anything possible if we think we deserve it.  I deserve this.  Thank you.", Shirley MacLaine, 1983 (56th) Academy Awards
 Actress in a Leading Role, Places in the Heart,"Oh, Benton, what you did for me; you changed my life, truly.  This means so much more to me this time.  I don't know why.  I think the first time I hardly felt it because it was all so new.  I owe a lot to the cast, to my players, to Lindsay and John and Danny and Ed and Amy and my little friends Gennie and Yankton.  I owe a lot to my family for holding me together and loving me and having patience with this obsession of me.  But I want to say thank you to you.  I haven't had an orthodox career and I've wanted more than anything to have your respect.  The first time I didn't feel it, but this time I feel it. And I can't deny the fact that you like me.  Right now, you like me!  Thank you.", Sally Field, 1984 (57th) Academy Awards

I wanted to say while Murray is here, thank you for the Mirror Repertory Company of which we're both members of the company.Well, thank Horton Foote for all this.  I'm so glad that the members of the Academy responded to ""Carrie Watts"" the way I did, evidently.  That's because the way he wrote it.  And I want to thank you for this for all of us in the company:  John Heard, and Carlin, and Richard Bradford, and Rebecca.  And it was all through the beautiful eye of Fred Murphy and the masterful direction, and his film debut as a director, Peter Masterson.  But mainly it's Horton's fault for all this.  So I thank you all.", Geraldine Page, 1985 (58th) Academy Awards

 Actress in a Leading Role, Moonstruck,"Now I want to really, I want to really say something.  [Laughs.]  When I was little my mother said, ""I want you to be something.""  And I guess this represents twenty-three or twenty-four years of my work, and I've never won anything before from my peers.  I'm really, really happy.  I'd like to thank everyone I worked on with the movie [sic].  They were really fabulous.  It was really a great experience for me.  My makeup man, who had a lot to work with; my hairdresser; my assistant; my children, who've been so wonderful.  The lady who taught me how to speak in this Brooklyn accent.And I would like to thank the women that I was nominated along with, because I feel really, really good because they were so great.  And I would also like to thank Mary Louise Streep, who I feel so unbelievable that I did my first movie with her and now I was nominated with her, and I feel really thankful.

The wonderful crew on ""The Accused,"" Jonathan Kaplan, Kelly McGillis, Tom Topor.  Paramount, the Academy, my schools—thank my schools.  And my family.  All my brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers out there.  And most importantly my mother Brandy, who taught me that all of my finger paintings were Picassos, and that I didn't have to be afraid. And mostly that cruelty might be very human, and it might be very cultural, but it's not acceptable.  Which is what this movie's about.  Thank you so much.", Jodie Foster, 1988 (61st) Academy Awards
 Actress in a Leading Role, Driving Miss Daisy,"I never expected in a million years that I would ever be in this position. It's a miracle.

The cast that was with me which made a wonderful, happy family.  It was a pleasure to go to work with them all each day.  And to Sam Cohn, who takes such good care of me.

 Actress in a Leading Role, The Silence of the Lambs,"This has been such an incredible year.  And I'd like to dedicate this award to all of the women who came before me who never had the chances that I've had, and the survivors and the pioneers and the outcasts; and my blood, my tradition.  And I'd like to thank all of the people in this industry who have respected my choices and who have not been afraid of the power and the dignity that that entitled me to.And I'd like to thank Ted Tally, and Thomas Harris, Jesse Kornbluth, everybody at Orion—the way it used to be, and the way it will always be in my heart.  John Douglas and everybody at Quantico.  The incredible cast and crew of ""Silence of the Lambs"" that Jonathan put together.  And of course, the reason that I'm here, Anthony Hopkins.

 Actress in a Leading Role, Howards End,"Ladies and gentlemen, I really don't know how to thank the Academy, not only for this [referring to the Oscar], but also for this view.  Because it's overwhelming to see so many faces who've entertained and influenced me and thrilled me all my life, and it just takes my breath away.  And if I could thank you all I would, but I have more pressing debts:  to E. M. Forster, for creating ""Margaret Schlegel;"" to James Ivory, for asking me to play her; to Ismail Merchant, for paying me to play her, which feels very unnecessary at this moment.  Actually, I think I might have to give back the money.  And to Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, for her flawless adaptation.  To a superlative cast and crew.  To Sony Pictures Classics, for their dedication and commitment.  And especially to Sir Anthony Hopkins, for being, like this, the (k)night of my life.  And finally I would like, if I may, to dedicate this Oscar to the heroism and the courage of women, and to hope that it inspires the creation of more true screen heroines to represent them.  Thank you so much.", Emma Thompson, 1992 (65th) Academy Awards
 Actress in a Leading Role, The Piano,"I'm so overwhelmed.  To be with that group of actresses just slays me.  When I was six years old I started pretending to play the piano on the window sills of my bedroom in the house where I grew up.  And then after a while my parents realized that I wasn't going to stop, so they got me a cardboard keyboard to play to see if that might, you know, if I would get tired of that.  But I wasn't.  I didn't.  And so then they got me a piano.  So for the next ten years they let me have piano lessons.  So I need to thank Eileen Parish, my first piano teacher, and I need to thank my parents for letting me have these lessons.And Jane Campion, I love you, I love you.  Thank you so much for giving me a character and an experience that was so difficult to say good-bye to, except that I don't have to say good-bye to it because it's everybody's now.  And that is such a gift.  And Michael Nyman, who really gave me a veritable instruction manual for a way into ""Ada McGrath"" by giving the music, giving me the music that he gave me and the entire movie to experience.  And Jan Chapman, our producer, for being so luminous and for giving ""The Piano"" and all of us a place to flourish.  Harvey and Bob Weinstein, you also break my heart with your uncensored passion and support for this movie.  And just thank you all so much for letting this movie in.

 Actress in a Leading Role, Blue Sky,"I want to thank the Academy so much.  This is such a wonderful honor, especially for a little film that seemed to have no future.  And it's just such a great honor.  I want to thank Orion Films, past and present, especially Marc Platt for letting us do this very peculiar little film in the first place.  And my dear friend Lynn Arost, the producer, who really stuck by the film even when it was sitting on a shelf in a bank vault in New York City.  To the writers of course, who created a marvelous character.  To the players, a wonderful group of actors that I was fortunate to work with, especially Mr. Tommy Lee Jones who really made the performance that I gave possible.  This is really a tribute to Tony Richardson.  He loved actors.  He loved everything about it.  He loved the acting, and he was the perfect person for me to work with.  He just kept nudging me over the edge, and with a character like this it's exactly what I needed.  And last of all, to my three children, who make all of this possible with their love and patience.  So thank you very, very much.", Jessica Lange, 1994 (67th) Academy Awards

 Actress in a Leading Role, Fargo,"It is impossible to maintain one's composure in this situation.  What am I doing here?  Especially considering the extraordinary group of women with whom I was nominated.  We five women were fortunate to have the choice, not just the opportunity but the choice, to play such rich, complex female characters. And I congratulate producers like Working Title and Polygram for allowing directors to make autonomous casting decisions based on qualifications and not just market value.  And I encourage writers and directors to keep these really interesting female roles coming, and while you're at it you can throw in a few for the men as well.My family, friends and colleagues here tonight and all around the world, they know exactly who they are, you know who you are.  And I hope you already know how much your support and your care means to me, but I'm gonna name three.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to the family that made this film, that gave me the opportunity to do something different:  John Lee Hancock, Gil Netter, Alcon, Warner Bros., the actors. Everyone who's shown me kindness when it wasn't fashionable, I thank you.  To everyone who was mean to me when it wasn't... like George Clooney threw me in a pool years ago.  I'm still holding a grudge.But there's so many people to thank; not enough time.  So I would like to thank what this film was about for me, which are the moms that take care of the babies and the children no matter where they come from.  Those moms and parents never get thanked.  I, in particular, failed to thank one.  So... if I can take this moment to thank Helga B. for not letting me ride in cars with boys till I was eighteen, 'cause she was right; I would've done what she said I was gonna do.  For making me practice every day when I got home, piano, ballet, whatever it is I wanted to be.  She said to be an artist you had to practice every day.  And for reminding her daughters that there's no race, no religion, no class system, no color, nothing, no sexual orientation, that makes us better than anyone else.  We are all deserving of love.  So, to that trailblazer who allowed me to have that, and this [referring to the Oscar], and this, I thank you so much for this opportunity that I share with these extraordinary women, and my lover Meryl Streep.

And to my team at CAA and I/D PR. And Bradley, and our entire cast – Chris, Jacki, Bob – and our crew. And my family. Happy birthday, Emmanuelle. Thank you so much.

 Actress in a Leading Role, Blue Jasmine,"Sit down; you're too old to be standing. Thank you, Mr. Day-Lewis. From you it exacerbates this honor to it and it blows it right out of the ballpark. Thank you so much to the Academy. As random and as subjective as this award is, it means a great deal in a year of extraordinary – yet again – extraordinary performances by women. Amy Adams, everything you do, but your performance in ""American Hustle"" blew my mind. And Meryl, what can I say? Sandra, I could watch that performance to the end of time, and I sort of felt like I had. Julia, #suckit. You know what I mean? And Judi Dench, I mean what a career. She's not here tonight because at the age of 79 her film was so successful that she's in India doing a sequel. I mean what a career that is, if I could hope.And me, I'm here accepting an award in an extraordinary screenplay by Woody Allen. Thank you so much, Woody, for casting me. I truly appreciate it. I'm so very proud that ""Blue Jasmine"" stayed in the cinemas for as long as it did. And thank you to Sony Classics, to Michael and Tom, for their extraordinary support, for so bravely and intelligently distributing the film. And to the audiences who went to see it, and perhaps those of us in the industry who are still foolishly clinging to the idea that female films with women at the center are niche experiences. They are not. Audiences want to see them and, in fact, they earn money. So... The world is round, people!Thank you to my mum, to my sister, to my brother, to my three glorious sons; I would not be standing here without you. To my husband Andrew, you are a legend. Thank you to my agent Hylda Queally; you're behind the pillar somewhere up there. You are a goddess. To my agent in Australia, Robyn Gardiner, I love you so very much. To my publicist Lisa Kasteler. To the sublime Sally Hawkins and to the extraordinary cast of ""Blue Jasmine,"" I don't know how to do this without other actors and this I share with you. To the hair and makeup people who sweated me up and tried to make me look attractive, thank you for the attempt. To Carla Meyer, for getting Sally and I together and for incredible support. To Helen Robin. To everyone involved in ""Blue Jasmine,"" I thank you so much.And finally, I would like to thank every single member of the Sydney Theatre Company, one of the great theater companies in the world. For me working on ""Blue Jasmine,"" it was a real synthesis of my work in the theater and on film. And not only working with you for the last six years has been the most enormous privilege of my career, but it's made me a better actress. There is so much talent in Australia, and Michael Wilkinson and CM and I are just tonight's tip of the iceberg. Thank you so much. Thank you.", Cate Blanchett, 2013 (86th) Academy Awards
 Actress in a Leading Role, Still Alice,"Thank you so much. I read an article that said that winning an Oscar could lead to living five years longer. If that's true, I'd really like to thank the Academy because my husband is younger than me. There's no such thing as best actress, as is evidenced by the performances of my fellow nominees. I've been honored to be among you every step of the way. I am grateful for this and grateful for the opportunity to stand up here and thank people that I love. My manager Evelyn O'Neill, Kevin Huvane, Steven Huvane, Josh Lieberman. My family: my grandparents, my brother Peter, my sister Valerie, my mother and father who told me that I could be whatever I wanted to be if I got an education. Although I didn't think they meant being an actress. And I thank my dad for showing me the world.I want to thank everybody who made this movie: Sony Classics, Killer Films, James Brown, Lex Lutzus, Lisa Genova, Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin. I'm so happy, I'm thrilled, actually, that we were able to hopefully shine a light on Alzheimer's disease. So many people with this disease feel isolated and marginalized, and one of the wonderful things about movies is it makes us feel seen and not alone. And people with Alzheimer's deserve to be seen, so that we can find a cure. And finally, to our filmmakers, Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, who had hoped to be here tonight but they can't because of Richard's health. When Richard was diagnosed with ALS, Wash asked him what he wanted to do. Did he want to travel? Did he want to see the world? And he said that he wanted to make movies, and that's what he did. And finally, for my husband Bart and our children, Cal and Liv, thank you for my life, thank you for giving me a home. Thank you very much for this.", Julianne Moore, 2014 (87th) Academy Awards
 Actress in a Leading Role, Room,"Thank you. Thank you first to the Academy. I want to start big because the thing that I love about moviemaking is how many people it takes to make it. So I want to start first with the Telluride Film Festival, the Toronto Film Festival, who gave us a chance, who gave us a platform first. I'd like to thank A24 for taking this movie into their hands and sharing it with the world. I'd like to thank our director Lenny Abrahamson, who is absolutely incredible. Emma Donoghue, who created this world. Jacob Tremblay, my partner through this in every way possible. My real partner, Alex Greenwald; I love you the whole thing.

To my mom and my dad and my brother Spencer and my soul sister Chrissy* and my whole family, I love you so much. Thank you for everything. And to Doug Wald, who stood by me all these years, and to Holly and Michelle and Craig and P.J. and Greta and Bob Cooper, thank you so much. And I realize that a moment like this is a huge confluence of luck and opportunity and so I want to thank Damien Chazelle for the opportunity to be part of a project that was so special and once in a lifetime. I'm so grateful to have been involved in this film. And thank you for your faith and your patience and such a wonderful experience. And Ryan Gosling, thank you for making me laugh and for always raising the bar and for being the greatest partner on this crazy adventure. To our whole crew, everyone that put their heart and souls into this film, I'm gonna find you all individually and I'm gonna thank you, along with my friends who I love so much, I am gonna hug the hell out of you when the feeling reenters my body. I still have a lot of growing and learning and work to do, and this guy is a really beautiful symbol to continue on that journey and I am so grateful for that. So thank you so much.

 Actress in a Leading Role," Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri","Okay. So I'm hyperventilating a little bit. If I fall over pick me up because I've got some things to say. So I think this is what Chloe Kim must have felt like after doing back-to-back 1080s in the Olympic halfpipe. Did you see that? Okay, that's what it feels like.I want to thank Martin McDonagh; look what you did. We are a bunch of hooligans and anarchists but we do clean up nice. I want to thank every single person in this building. And my sister Dorothy. I love you, Dot. And I especially want to thank my clan, Joel and Pedro ""McCoen.""

I know you are proud of me and that fills me with everlasting joy.And now, I want to get some perspective. If I may be so honored to have all the female nominees in every category stand with me in this room tonight. The actors—Meryl, if you do it everybody else will, c'mon. The filmmakers. The producers. The directors. The writers. The cinematographer. The composers. The songwriters. The designers. C'mon! Okay. Look around, everybody. Look around, ladies and gentlemen, because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed. Don't talk to us about it at the parties tonight.

 Actress in a Supporting Role, Murder on the Orient Express,"Thank you very much indeed.  It's always very nice to get an Oscar.  But in the past he has shown that he is very forgetful and also has the wrong timing. Because last year when ""Day and Night"" won for the best picture I couldn't believe it that Valentina Cortese was not nominated, because she gave the most beautiful performance.  [Finds Cortese in the audience:]  There you are!  She gave the most beautiful performance that all we actresses recognized because, after all, we have all forgotten our lines and always open the wrong doors, and it was wonderful to see her do it so beautifully.  Therefore I am... It's so ironic that this year she's nominated when the picture won last year.  I don't quite understand that, but here I am and I'm her rival and I don't like it at all.  Please forgive me, Valentina.  I didn't mean to.  Thank you.", Ingrid Bergman, 1974 (47th) Academy Awards

But I would like to thank the artistic community for sustaining me in my wins and losses and sitting on the curb, whatever it was.  I don't think there's an award for what Warren Beatty had to do to get ""Shampoo"" on, but I respect him and love him, and Robert Towne.  And my director Hal Ashby, who encourages an actor to fly without a net because you know that he's there to catch you.  Thank you.", Lee Grant, 1975 (48th) Academy Awards
 Actress in a Supporting Role, Network,"It's very heavy.  And I'm the dark horse.  And thank you so much, all of you. It's a great, great thrill for me and very unexpected.  Though I should have known that when I had someone like Paddy Chayefsky writing and saying things that we all feel but can't express, and when we have someone like Sidney Lumet who makes one want to act forever, and a producer like Howard Gottfried, then how can I miss?  But I know that my mother would be delighted.  She had great potential for an actress but didn't think she should do it, so she pushed me and was delighted.  And Michael Chekhov, the great actor and teacher who I studied with, who gave me a love and respect for the theater, which is the whole point of why we're all here.  It's a great profession and we have to keep thinking it all the time.  And we all do.  And we all love it.  And I'm so grateful for that and for a wonderful lady, age ninety-three, who lives here in Los Angeles, who's watching tonight.  One of our first women directors, who directed Paul Robeson in ""Othello"" in London:  Ellen van Volkenburg Browne.  Bright as ever.  Thank you.

 Actress in a Supporting Role, Julia,"My dear colleagues, I thank you very, very much for this tribute to my work. I think that Jane Fonda and I have done the best work of our lives and I think this was in part due to our director, Fred Zinnemann.  And I also think it's in part because we believed and we believe in what we were expressing. Two, out of millions, who gave their lives and were prepared to sacrifice everything in the fight against fascist and racist Nazi Germany.  And I salute you and I pay tribute to you and I think you should be very proud that in the last few weeks you've stood firm and you have refused to be intimidated by the threats of a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums whose behavior is an insult to the stature of Jews all over the world and to their great and heroic record of struggle against fascism and oppression.  And I salute that record, and I salute all of you for having stood firm and dealt a final blow against that period when Nixon and McCarthy launched a worldwide witch hunt against those who tried to express in their lives and their work the truth that they believed in.  I salute you, and I thank you, and I pledge to you that I will continue to fight against anti-Semitism and fascism.  Thank you.", Vanessa Redgrave, 1977 (50th) Academy Awards

Nobody ever accused me of being a fast talker but I'm gonna try tonight because this supporting actress was supported by a great many people, a few whom I would like to quickly thank.I'd like to thank my family in Arkansas for always believing against all odds that something like this was gonna happen.  And then I'd like to thank two teachers, Sandy Meisner and Kenneth Gillam*, for the profound influence that they had upon my work.  And then if anybody ever had a patron saint it was me. In 1977, when he insisted on casting me as his leading lady in a film called ""Goin' South,"" everybody told him he was crazy.  But thank goodness for me that he was and is Jack Nicholson.  Thank you very much.There's a couple more.  Thank you, Melvin Dummar, for the inspiration.  Bo Goldman, for the simple splendor of your words.  And Jonathan Demme, thank you for your vision and your talent and for the plain, old-fashioned fun it was to work with you.  Thank you, Don Phillips and Art Linson, our producers.

 Actress in a Supporting Role, The Year of Living Dangerously,"This is extraordinary.  There was an Indonesian phrase in the film which translates into English as ""water from the moon.""  And it means that which is unattainable, the impossible, that which one can never have or know.  Making ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" for me was ""water from the moon.""I want to thank the members of the Academy so much for honoring me with this recognition and this encouragement at the beginning of my work in film, when I still have so much to learn about such a complex and a powerful medium.

The heart of any movie lies with the director and I've been incredibly lucky on this and many films to work with the singular Tim Burton.  Tim's imagination along with the amazing cast – Johnny's incandescent ""Hatter,"" Mia's ""Alice"" for all girls all times, Helena's the fearless, big-headed queen, and our crystalline snowflake princess Anne Hathaway – made my job a delight.

It was a year of our lives in the Namibian desert. We had the most amazing crew. I hope that some, I'd heard they were on ticker tape, I thought they'd, that the names were going on the screen. But honestly, if anybody wants to know more about any of them just get in touch with me through my wonderful agents Wayne Fitterman from William Morris and Sue Latimer from ARG. But it was an incredible experience. But I just want to say one quite serious thing and I've been thinking about this a lot.

But I feel very lucky that we have it and even luckier in our colleagues in filming, Dick Pearce, Tom Cohen and Brennon Jones, and in editing, Lynzee Klingman and Susan Martin, who deserve the award equally with Bert and me.

And who I hope will go to bed now.  Thank you.BERT SCHNEIDER:First of all, I would like to say a special thank you to my late brother Stanley whose support and love and encouragement allowed us to make this film and all of the films that BBS made.  It is ironic that we are here at a time just before Vietnam is about to be liberated.  I will now read a short wire that I have been asked to read by the Vietnamese people.  It is sent by Ambassador Dinh Ba Thi, who is the chief of the Provisional Revolutionary Government's delegation to Paris, the Paris political talks.  It says: ""Please transmit to all our friends in America our recognition of all that they have done on behalf of peace and for the application of the Paris Accords on Vietnam.

 Documentary (Feature), Best Boy,"So what's a nice Jewish boy from Queens doing in a place like this?  This is a great personal honor for me and it's particularly wonderful because it's associated with a film of which I feel so very proud.  ""Best Boy"" took three-and-a-half years to make but it was very much a labor of love.  And it tells the story of my fifty-two-year-old cousin Philly, who's mentally retarded, and his parents who are near eighty and about how he finally comes to separate from them as their lives end and his life has to go on.  The film has been seen mainly on the East Coast, and with documentaries it's not always easy to get people to come and see the film.  And if this award will help more people to come and see it then it will really be doing its job.I want to thank the Association for the Help of Retarded Children in New York City for their support of the film and for the wonderful work they did with Philly.  I want to thank the entire crew, but in particular Tom McDonough, director of photography, who gave his sensitivity and intelligence and understanding and made the film much more than it would have otherwise been. I want to thank my cousins Frances and Norman, my aunt and uncle who are no longer alive, my aunt Pearl, my uncle Max.  And most of all I want to thank my cousin Philly who gave me the opportunity to do the most important thing I've ever done in my life and who has continually reminded me how very delicate and beautiful any single human life can be.

There are a few people I must thank, and too few in the time we have.  First and foremost, the executive producer Walter Scheuer, who had the vision not only to initiate the project but the courage to finance it, and that took a lot of courage because it was a long and complex project.  Allan Miller, Tom Haneke and the editorial crew who so beautifully completed the film.  The location crew who, challenged by what they saw in China, worked with me unceasingly from dawn until midnight throughout the length of the production.  But most of all I would like to thank the Chinese people who greeted us so warmly and allowed us to film what for them was unusual in such an open and frank way.In the face of so much senseless violence in the world I hope that this vote is a vote not only for the film, but for a process:  the fellowship—communication through the fellowship of music which imparts harmony into the human heart rather than violence.  And I hope that this and I believe it can contribute in some way towards our living together peacefully both as neighbors and as nations.

Thirty-eight years later we film, with Denis Poncet, a story about a teenager who had been stopped, arrested and sent to jail because he was just a black kid walking in the street near a crime scene.  And if we are doing documentaries, that [is] because we do believe that as storyteller[s] we can help dreams come true.DENIS PONCET:Just one thing because I know that time is up.  This film was supposed to stay in Europe and thanks to somebody called Christine Le Goff it came to the United States.  It is thanks to wonderful people at HBO like Sheila Nevins and Nancy Abraham [that] this was possible for you to see, I hope, one day and very close, soon on HBO.

 Directing, Gigi,"Ever since ""Gigi"" was written years ago by Colette it's been produced through the years in many mediums, many versions and many languages, and it has a history of bringing wonderful things to the lives of people connected with these productions.  I know personally of a great many of them and I'm sure there're a great many more.  And it's brought wonderful things to us connected to this movie.

 Directing, The Graduate,"Until this moment my greatest pleasure in ""The Graduate"" was making it, because it's a picture made by a group. And we cared for each other and we cared for what we were doing. So this award quite literally belongs to them at least as much as it does to me. I'm grateful to them and to the Academy and to the movies themselves. And I'd also like to wish my mother a happy birthday. Thank you.", Mike Nichols, 1967 (40th) Academy Awards
 Directing, Oliver!,"Not having made a musical before you can imagine what I owe to other people. There's Onna White and of course Lionel Bart and Johnny Green, but so many others that have helped me throughout it. But I would like to just make a special mention for our producer, John Woolf.

Thank you.", John Schlesinger, 1969 (42nd) Academy Awards
 Directing, Patton,"I'm sure if Franklin Schaffner were here tonight he would say that it's an honor to accept this award. I know he would thank you for it. But since he isn't… [Ryan O'Neal delivers the Oscar to the podium.] Thank you, Ryan. But since he isn't here, let me say that you couldn't have given it to a better fella. He deserves it.

 Directing, The French Connection,"This is a tremendous honor and I'm very proud to accept it.  I'm proud, too, of the people that helped me to make ""The French Connection"":  the people of Twentieth Century-Fox; the entire cast and crew, especially Roy Scheider and Gene Hackman for their fine performances; Jerry Greenberg, for his cutting; Owen Roizman, for his photography.  But most of all, I would like to thank the man who made it all possible, not only made it possible for the picture to be made but for me to direct it.  I owe it all to him.  His name is Phil D'Antoni.  Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.", William Friedkin, 1971 (44th) Academy Awards
 Directing, Cabaret,"Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  I must say I feel a little like Clint Eastwood, that you're letting me stand up here because Coppola or Mankiewicz hasn't shown up yet.  But being characteristically a pessimist and cynic, this and some of the other nice things that have happened to me the last couple days may turn me into some sort of hopeful optimist and ruin my whole life.There's so many people to thank.  You've heard a lot of the names, but it's important for me to say them, and I'm sure I'm gonna miss some of the ones and regret it tomorrow.  Of course Liza, and Joel, Michael York, Marisa Berenson, Marty Baum, Manny Wolf, Kander and Ebb.  A terrific guy by the name of Doug Green.  A dear friend of mine by the name of Gwen Verdon.  And I'd also like to mention Cy Feuer, the producer, with whom I had a lot of disputes.  But on a night like this you start having affection for everybody.  Thank you.", Bob Fosse, 1972 (45th) Academy Awards
 Directing, The Sting,"Thank you all very much.  I'd like to thank the members of the Academy.  I also have a bit of advice for my fellow directors, and that's next time out get a script by David Ward; get a cameraman like the great Bob Surtees; get Marion Dougherty to do your casting for you that might include a Bob Shaw; and pull in a couple of ringers like Newman and Redford.  And it helps, believe me.  Thank you very much.", George Roy Hill, 1973 (46th) Academy Awards
 Directing, The Godfather Part II,"I almost won this a couple of years ago for the first half of the same picture.  That's not why we did ""The Godfather Part II,"" however.  It was Charlie Bluhdorn's idea.  And when I heard it I said, at first, my God, to do a sequel to ""The Godfather"" is a sure-fire way to fail and blow everything I was lucky enough to get up to that point.  And then I went home and I thought about it, and I realized that because it maybe was such an easy way to fail, which was probably the best reason to try to tackle what seems so impossible. And it's, I'm really happy I did.  I just want to thank Gordie Willis who was the photographer, who did a beautiful job.  And Barry Malkin, Richie Marks and Peter Zinner, who cut the picture, who all contributed.  And Walter Murch, who did the sound.  Thank you so much.  And thanks for giving my dad an Oscar. Thank you.", Francis Ford Coppola, 1974 (47th) Academy Awards
 Directing, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,"First, I thank the Academy for the company of the nominees they did put me in.  I'm very proud of that.  When I want to think what possible reasons I am here now I can find two.  The first is that this year the Academy members recognized the fact that last year I spent more time in mental institution than the others.  And the second might be that, well, that America still is big, beautiful, hospitable and open country.  And I thank you so, Michael, Jack, Louise, Ken Kesey, and especially I am to thank all those whose names I don't have time to mention now.  Thank you.", Milos Forman, 1975 (48th) Academy Awards
 Directing, Rocky,"Oh my goodness.  I guess what ""Rocky""did was give a lot of people hope, and there was never a better feeling than doing that.  And I had a lot of people who gave me things.  Sylvester Stallone gave me his guts and his heart and his best shot.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Gene Kirkwood, the executive producer, gave me a telephone call and said, I got a script here and it's called ""Rocky"" and I think you'd like it.  Thank you, Gene.  Bill Conti, the musical director of this show, gave me the inspiration with his beautiful music.  Jim Crabe, my cameraman, gave me his eyes.  My cast gave me their talent:  Talia, and Burt, and Burgess, Carl Weathers, Joe Spinell, and Jimmy Gambina who gave us the knowledge of his fighting.  In Philadelphia I had men giving me their energy: Lloyd Kaufman, Ralf Bode, Mike Scott, Joe Letizia, Garrett Brown and Ralf Hotchkiss.  And at United Artists I had some men give me their confidence: Mike Medavoy, and Eric Pleskow, and Bob Chartoff and Irwin Winkler.  Thank you.  My agent, my agent Marvin Moss gave me, besides some very good recipes, his counsel.  Holly Hein gave me her wisdom.  Melissa Avildsen and Anthony Avildsen, my son, and Rufus Avildsen, my son who helped me pick the locations in Philadelphia, gave me their love.  And thank you all very much.", John G.

 Directing, The Deer Hunter,"At a moment like this it's difficult to leaven pride with humility.  But I am proud to be here and proud of our work, proud to be part of this tradition. I'm proud of my dear and very special associates:  Joann Carelli, Barry Spikings, Chris Walken, John Savage, Meryl Streep, the late John Cazale, and most especially I embrace Robert De Niro for his dedication and for his great dignity of heart.

 Directing, Ordinary People,"Thank you.  I was thinking—no, I wasn't thinking, I was just kind of blank. But you know how it is when somebody says to you, if you, about a year before, they say:  You know, if anybody'd told you a year ago that you would have been ""dot, dot, dot.""  Well, I just didn't think I was gonna see this. But I'm no less grateful.  And I would like to express my debt for the directors that I worked with in the past, for what I've learned from them, consciously or unconsciously.  And I would also like to say that, it may not be too fashionable but the fact is that I really do appreciate the support of Paramount Pictures, Charlie Bluhdorn, Barry Diller.  They let us make the film the way we wanted to and I'm very grateful for that.There are a lot of people that I can thank, and I don't want to go on too long, but I couldn't go too much further without expressing what for me is the greatest gratitude.  And that keys around the word trust.  I really am grateful for the trust that I received from a terrific cast:  Mary, Donald, Tim, Judd, Liz.  I love them, and I appreciate their love, too.  So thank you all.", Robert Redford, 1980 (53rd) Academy Awards
 Directing, Reds,"Thank you.  Miss Keaton, I know that public expressions like this can be embarrassing sometimes and that my chances of speaking with you privately later are at the moment excellent.  I do want to tell you that you make every director that you work with look good, and I think that what they're trying to tell me here tonight, thank God, is that I'm no exception.  Mr. Nicholson, I know that you're enjoying my being up here almost as much as I am in being here.I know I do one thing well, I get good people:  Elaine May, Peter Feibleman, Jeremy Pikser, Robert Towne, Simon Relph, Zelda Barron, Richie Cirincione, Steve Sondheim, Dave Grusin, David MacLeod, so many, many more among whom are the people that you've nominated here tonight and happily saved me from having to remember to name fourteen more names.  I do want to name Mr. Barry Diller who runs Paramount, Mr. Dick Zimbert who's been very kind to me, Mr. Frank Mancuso, and Mr. Charles Bluhdorn who runs Gulf + Western and God knows what else.  And I want to say to you gentlemen that no matter how much we might have liked to have strangled each other from time to time, I think that your decision, taken in the great capitalistic tower of Gulf + Western, to finance a three-and-a-half hour romance which attempts to reveal for the first time just something of the beginnings of American socialism and American communism, reflects credit not only upon you, I think it reflects credit upon Hollywood and the movie business wherever that is.  And I think that it reflects more particular credit on the freedom of expression that we have in our American society and the lack of censorship that we have from the government or the people who put up the money.  Thanks.", Warren Beatty, 1981 (54th) Academy Awards
 Directing, Gandhi,"Ladies and gentlemen, fellow members of the Academy, without Jo Child and Jake Eberts and the National Film Development Corporation of India, the film would not have been made.  Without Marty Baum, I would never have been able to maintain my courage.  I am totally bowled over by this and I think an enormous contribution to my holding it must go to Frank Price and Columbia Pictures for their courage in agreeing to distribute it.  There are many people I would like to thank, and some you have already honored.  But, I would simply say to Sidney Lumet and Sydney Pollack and Wolfgang Petersen and Steven Spielberg, I am honored to be in their company.  Thank you very much.", Richard Attenborough, 1982 (55th) Academy Awards
 Directing, Terms of Endearment,"I feel like I've been beaten up.  It's strange.  This was in the truest sense of the word, enormously collaborative film.  Andrzej Bartkowiak's talent is on every frame.  Richard Marks was a dream in the cutting room.  A friend of mine named Dave Davis worked with me from beginning to end.  Polly Platt made an extraordinary contribution.  Kristi Zea's costumes meant a lot because to the picture -- I think the picture depended so much on detail.  And I'm overwhelmed.  I'm very grateful.  Holly, you're great.  Okay, thank you very much.", James L. Brooks, 1983 (56th) Academy Awards
 Directing, Amadeus,"I must express my admiration for my colleagues who are nominated tonight. The result of their work is making this moment for me so much more thrilling. I want to thank Peter Shaffer for writing the play and the screenplay, Robby Lantz for introducing me to the play, and Saul Zaentz for producing the film. I want to thank the whole company of actors and the whole company behind the camera, namely Twyla Tharp, Neville Marriner, Miroslav Ondrícek, and Wolfgang Mozart.I have to greet my colleagues and students at the Columbia University Film Department.  And finally, I am very proud because this is an American movie on which a lot of Czechoslovakian artists and technicians collaborated.  To get this kind of recognition from the members of Academy for this kind of collaboration, I think, is very encouraging for more than artistic or box-office reasons.  Thank you very much.", Milos Forman, 1984 (57th) Academy Awards
 Directing, Out of Africa,"Thank you very much.  Frank Price made this film possible.  He had the courage when it mattered the most and was easy to say no.  I knew it was impossible to get a screenplay from this material so I didn't try; Kurt Luedtke didn't know it was impossible and so he did it.  David Rayfiel kept us honest.  Meryl, Bob, Klaus and Malick brought those characters to life and made an incredible world.  All of us being helped all the time by Terry Clegg who kept us going.  I had a team of editors who locked themselves in a room with me seven days a week, twelve hours a day and behaved as though nothing else in the world existed.  John Barry made it all sing.  Karen Blixen lived that life and turned it into art and taught a generation a new way to write prose.  My wife Claire gave me more encouragement than I have any right to have, put up with more, was more tolerant.  I'm indebted to all of them.  I can't leave this podium without saying, I could not have made this film without Meryl Streep.  She is astounding personally, professionally, in all ways, and I can't thank her enough.  Thank you.", Sydney Pollack, 1985 (58th) Academy Awards
 Directing, Platoon,"Thank you.  Thank you for this ""Cinderella"" ending.  But I think that through this award you're really acknowledging the Vietnam veteran.  And I think what you're saying is that for the first time, you really understand what happened over there.  And I think what you're saying is that it should never, ever in our lifetimes happen again.  And if it does, then those American boys died over there for nothing, because America learned nothing from the Vietnam War.My special thanks go to my cast and crew.  To Tom and Charlie and Willem.  To Bob Richardson, Claire Simpson, Bruno Rubeo, the rest of you.  My producers: Arnold Kopelson, Derek Gibson, Alex Ho.  To Captain Dale Dye, who gave his heart and soul for the movie.  To Marion Billings, Andrea Jaffe, Paula Wagner, Mike Mitchell and Bob Marshall.  And to Mr. John Daly, who gave me a shot when nobody else would.  And to my wife Elizabeth, whose deep abiding love got me through the despair.  Thank you.", Oliver Stone, 1986 (59th) Academy Awards
 Directing, The Last Emperor,"Thank you.  It was a very long way from down there.  As an Italian, as a European, the Academy Awards has always seemed to me like a distant ceremony. Something fascinating, very  remote.  Something I really didn't belong to. Then one day ""The Last Emperor"" got nine nomination and everything change immediately.  I became immediately a kind of Oscar victim.  I started to learn the rule of the game and to take, to check the odds, started the colitis, and the beta blockers, the Inderal, all these things.  I mean, I became a kind of Oscar victim.I want to do a Chinese kowtow to the Academy because this is one of the strongest emotion of my life and I can't hide it.  I want to thank the Chinese who allowed me to shoot in their beautiful country.  And the Chinese emperor, John Lone, the Chinese empress, Joan Chen.  And all the wonderful people who gave me their creativity in front, behind and around the camera.  I can't name all of them; they're wonderful.  And I was just thinking that if New York is the big apple, to me Hollywood tonight is the big nipple.  Thank you very much.", Bernardo Bertolucci, 1987 (60th) Academy Awards
 Directing, Rain Man,"Thank you.  This is really about two actors: Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman. If they don't deliver, and the performances that they gave, I wouldn't be up here this evening.  I have to tell you, I'm so—I'm so shook up.  I'm so taken by the response to ""Rain Man"" and that we've had such a positive effect on the audiences that have seen the movie.  I'm really appreciative.  I thank all you people from the Academy.  We have a wonderful staff that did a lot of work on autism.  We tried to be as faithful as we could and in the same time try to be entertaining.  I have to thank Michael Ovitz who worked to keep this movie alive when we were, a lot of times when it may not have ever happened.  And I have to thank my wife Diana who, when I walked into the bedroom, when I said, ""I can do 'Rain Man,'"" and she was seven months pregnant.  I said, ""What do you want to do?""  And she said, ""Let's go on the road and do the movie and have the baby wherever we're traveling to.""  We had a little baby boy and I thank her for that.  And I thank you for this [holding up the Oscar].", Barry Levinson, 1988 (61st) Academy Awards
 Directing, Born on the Fourth of July,"My deepest thanks for your acknowledgment that Vietnam is not over, although some people say it is.  But that Vietnam is a state of mind that continues all over the world for as long as men in his [sic] quest for power interfere in the affairs of other men.  So many thanks to give tonight.  I want to give it to Ron Kovic for his largeness of heart.  And to Tom Cruise, for making Ron's dream come true.  And to a great supporting cast in that true, thankless meaning of the word.  To a crew that never failed: to Bob Richardson, and Bruno Rubeo, David Brenner, John Williams, Alex Ho, Clayton Townsend, Joe Reidy.  To the people of Dallas, Texas.  To the warm people of the Philippines.  To Tom Pollock and Universal Pictures.  To Wylie and Mike Minkler.  To Paula Wagner, my guardian angel.  And to Elizabeth, my naijo no ko.  Thank you for this night.", Oliver Stone, 1989 (62nd) Academy Awards
 Directing, Dances With Wolves,"I didn't trust myself [looking at his notes].  I don't even when I make the movies, I have to write everything down.Everyone knows that you really don't make pictures by yourself and I accept this tonight on behalf of, of my friends, people that influenced my life, influenced this movie: Jim Wilson and Michael Blake.  I'd like a special thanks to go out to Guy East and Jake Eberts and the people at Majestic.  The same people who came down to Mexico and watched my little slide show and tried to figure out through all my boyish enthusiasm that I was deadly serious about making this movie.  I'd like to thank Bill Bernstein and Mike Medavoy who made two movies with me and allowed me to direct this third.  To Michael Ovitz for his careful reconstruction that helped me finish ""Dances"" without having to compromise my dream.  And finally, I'd like to share this award with my wife Cindy and my three children, my brother, and my parents who I'm so happy that we're alive to share this together.  Thank you very much.", Kevin Costner, 1990 (63rd) Academy Awards
 Directing, The Silence of the Lambs,"In the context of my movie-loving life this is very unanticipated.  The only way I can really understand this is to recognize that I had the great good fortune to have a chance to work with Ted Tally's great adaptation of Thomas Harris' extraordinarily moral and amazing book, and to have the good fortune to work with the likes of Tak Fujimoto and Kristi Zea, Craig McKay and Tommy Fleischman and Chris Newman and Howard Shore and Howard Feuer and Billy Miller and, and everybody.  And also to be able to work with such an ensemble cast of actors:  with Jodie and Tony of course, and also Ted Levine for his exceptionally courageous performance as ""Jame Gumb,"" and Scott Glenn and Anthony Heald and Brooke Smith and Diane Baker, and all the other wonderful actors.I also—this won't take forever, sorry—I also had the extraordinary good fortune to have been embraced by Orion Pictures at a time which, unlike this amazing peak moment of my life, I was at a kind of low-valley moment when Mike Medavoy and Bill Bernstein and Arthur Krim and Eric Pleskow kind of reached out to me and encouraged me and  helped create a home for my collaborators and myself.  And we made some movies for them.  And I'll never forget when Mike Medavoy said, ""I think there's a book you might be interested in.  I'll send it over.""  And it's obvious, I know everybody feels the extraordinary irony of what's happened, this terrible thing that's happened to Orion at a moment of re-emergence that included ""Silence of the Lambs"" and many other things.Anyway, two other quick things.  I'm sorry, this is almost—one, just about directing.  I wanted very much to salute John Singleton and Matty Rich and Jodie Foster and Ernest Dickerson and a bunch of new people in the last year that have come on with very exciting, wonderful visions and really breathed tremendously important new life into our whole cinematic landscape.  And I really want to salute those people very strongly.  I also want to very, very quickly—I had the good fortune of being encouraged and briefed by two great American filmmakers who are no longer with us.  And I very much, I'm thrilled to be able to invoke the recent memory of two great men, two great filmmakers: Hal Ashby and Martin Ritt, who were really, really wonderful to me.And finally, I've obviously got to say, ""Hi, Mom,"" and thanks for transferring your love of movies to me.  And thanks, Dad, for making me think I could actually be part of this industry.  And thank you.  Thank you.", Jonathan Demme, 1991 (64th) Academy Awards
 Directing, Unforgiven,"Pacino's throat was dry, mine's really dry.  To sit here all this time...  I just, um... this is pretty good, this is alright.  I've been around for thirty-nine years, and I've really enjoyed it.  I've been very lucky.  I heard Al [Pacino] say he was lucky, but everybody feels that way when you're able to make a living in a profession that you really enjoy.  That's an opportunity I think a lot of people don't have.I've got to thank the crew, David Valdes, and Jack Green, and all the camera crew -- the trouble is with living this long is you know so many people and you can't remember their names.  You get a little flustered.  But in the year of the woman I'd like to salute the women of Big Whiskey.  That would be Anna Thomson, and Frances Fisher, and Liisa, and Tara, and Josie, and Beverley, and all the gals who really were the catalyst to getting this story off the ground.  And David Peoples' fabulous script.  Warner Bros., for sticking with this film.  The film critics, for discovering this film.  It wasn't a highly tout[ed] film when it came out but they sort of stayed with it throughout the year.  The French film critics who embraced some of my work very early in the game, the British Film Institute, the Museum of Modern Art are some of the people that were there long before I ever became fashionable.  Lenny Hirshan, my agent,...I'm leaving out a whole mess of people I'm gonna regret when I sit down again.  Anyway, thank you very much.", Clint Eastwood, 1992 (65th) Academy Awards
 Directing, Schindler's List,"I actually, I have friends who have won this before, but -- and I swear -- I have never held one before.  This is the first time I've ever had one of these in my hand.  Oh, dear.Let me just start by saying that this never could have happened, this never could have gotten started without a survivor named Poldek Pfefferberg who Oskar Schindler saved from Auschwitz, from Belsen.  He's the man who talked Thomas Keneally into writing the book.  I owe him such a debt.  All of us owe him such a debt.  He has carried the story of Oskar Schindler to all of us.  A man of complete obscurity who makes us wish and hope for Oskar Schindlers in all of our lives.I have to thank, I want to thank Sid Sheinberg for giving me the book.  Thank you, Sid.  I want to thank Steve Zaillian for a screenplay of inordinate restraint.  I have great actors in this movie.  Liam, thank you.  Ralph, thank you.  Ben Kingsley, thank you.  I want to thank my wife, who's here with me tonight, for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row in Krakow, Poland, last winter when things got just too unbearable.  And my mom who's here, who is my lucky charm, whom I love very, very much.  And to the six million who can't be watching this among the one billion watching this telecast tonight.

 Directing, Braveheart,"Oh, I don't write speeches but I would like to thank a few people.  And I have it on a list, not a long list.  Not too long anyway.  I mean, I'd like to thank the Academy first of all, and Alan Ladd, Jr. and Randall Wallace who first came to me with the script.  Randy wrote it, Laddy was attached as the producer.  And they had no problem with giving the reins to a fiscal imbecile. You know, this takes real courage.  My production company at Icon -- Bruce Davey, Steve McEveety, Dean Lopata, my right hand man.  And everyone at Icon. Paramount and Fox, who both went in, they double dipped, Sherry Lansing, Jon Dolgen, Barry London, Peter Chernin, Bill Mechanic, Jim Gianopulos.  It's one of the best cast and crews I've ever worked with.  John Toll, who's already been honored here tonight.  Tom Sanders, Charles Knode, Steve Rosenblum, David Tomblin -- thanks for dragging me through the mud sometimes.  James Horner, Mic Rodgers, Simon Crane, and the clan Wallace.  We mustn't forget the clan Wallace.  Nigel Sinclair, Ed Limato, Jeff Berg, Alan Nierob, Paul Bloch, Rod Lurie, my wife and family for indulging me.  And God, for indulging me in this tiny moment.  And every director I've ever worked with, they were my film school.  And now that I'm a bona fide director with a golden boy, I uh, well, like most directors I suppose what I really want to do is act.  Is that right? Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  This is a truly wonderful evening for me.  Thank you.", Mel Gibson, 1995 (68th) Academy Awards

They really threw down for me.  So, Kate, Gloria, Leo, Kathy, Frances and Billy, Bill, Suzy, Lewis, and about eighty others, you guys gave me pure gold every day and I share this gold with you.

 Directing, Saving Private Ryan,"Thank you.  Am I allowed to say I really wanted this?  This is fantastic. Let me just turn my eyes to Mr. Hanks who from the very, very beginning said to me, this is going to be something extraordinary.  We weren't really talking about the film, we were talking about the experience of making ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and he was right.  It is one of the most extraordinary events of all of our lives, and the lives of all of our families, we were all in it together. Katie, for putting up with how much I've worried about this movie for the last eighteen months.  Thank you for letting me be a neurotic at home.  And all my children.  I have two kids here tonight and they've never been to the Oscars before and I'm really happy I had a chance to make Max and Theo proud of their dad, and they're sitting up there somewhere.  Thank you, kids, very, very much.  And my other kids at home, Mikaela and Destry and Sasha and Sawyer, and Jessica who is here, too.This has just been an amazing experience and what I'd like to do is just thank very, very sincerely the families who lost sons in World War II.  I want to thank the Niland family and the Sullivan families, and I want to thank all the families who incurred these tremendous losses.  In this war we tried to show a story of one such family, and it turned up there were many such families, unfortunately.  And Dad, you're the greatest.  Thank you for showing me that there is honor in looking back and respecting the past.  I love you very much.  This is for you.  Thank you.", Steven Spielberg, 1998 (71st) Academy Awards

It's an honor to be here.

So thank you, Glenn Williamson, Bob Cooper, Walter Parkes, Laurie MacDonald, Jeffrey Katzenberg, David Geffen, Terry Press, and especially thank you to Steven Spielberg for handing me this script in the first place, for handing me this [referring to the Oscar], and for being so generous with your wisdom.Thank you to a fantastic, fantastic cast of actors.

 Directing, Traffic,"Suddenly, going to work tomorrow doesn't seem like such a good idea.  My daughter Sarah's asleep in London.  She's missing this, unfortunately.  There are a lot of people to thank.  Rather than thank some of them publicly, I think I'll thank all of them privately.  What I want to say is -- I want to thank anyone who spends part of their day creating.  I don't care if it's a book, a film, a painting, a dance, a piece of theater, a piece of music...

 Directing, A Beautiful Mind,"Thank you.  Golden boy?  Well, I am not a good enough actor anymore to be able to stand up here and make you believe that I haven't imagined this moment in my mind over the years and played it out about a thousand times.  So here goes.It's pretty simple, really.  I'm grateful.  I'm very grateful for this.  I'm grateful for an entire lifetime spent involved in this creative process that we do.  I'm grateful that I was raised by an extraordinary man, my father Rance Howard, and my late mother Jean Howard.  I also want to mention that before my mom passed away about eighteen months ago, she predicted that this was going to happen for me on this film. Well, she also made that prediction on every movie that I've directed since 1983.  So now you know a little something about my mom.  Thank you, Mom.  Then there are the loves of my life. My incredible wife Cheryl.  Yeah, she's something.  Kids at home, Bryce, Jocelyn, Paige and Reed.  Thank you for all the most important reasons.I've got a great friend and a partner, Brian Grazer.  Brian, thanks for helping me realize so many of my dreams in this business, including getting to direct ""A Beautiful Mind,"" which Brian produced so passionately and Akiva Goldsman wrote so brilliantly.  You know, everyone from the decision makers at Universal and DreamWorks through to the entire production team, thank you for the incredible effort.  It made the difference.And of course I had a tremendous cast.  This is an acting movie.  And including Jennifer Connelly.  And Russell.  Russell Crowe.

She was only eighty-four then. But she's here with me again tonight. So, at ninety-six, I'm thanking her for her genes.It was a wonderful adventure. To make a picture in thirty-seven days it takes a well-oiled machine. And that well-oiled machine is a crew--the cast, of course, you've met a lot of them, but there's still Margo and Anthony and Michael and Mike and Jay and everybody else who was so fabulous in this cast. And the crew: Campanelli and Billy Coe and, of course, Tom Stern, who is fantastic. And Henry Bumstead, the great Henry Bumstead, who is the head of our crack geriatrics team. And Henry and Jack Taylor and Dick Goddard, all those guys. And Walt and everybody. I can't think of everybody now; I'm beginning to get a blank--but, Warren [Beatty], you were right.

 Directing, Brokeback Mountain,"[To the Oscar statuette:]  Wow, I wish I knew how to quit you.First of all, I want to thank two people who don't even exist, or I should say, they do exist because of the imagination of Annie Proulx and the artistry of Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana.  Their names are ""Ennis"" and ""Jack"" and they taught all of us who made ""Brokeback Mountain"" so much about, not just all the gay men and women whose love is denied by society, but just as important, the greatness of love itself.  Thank you.  Thank you, members of the Academy, for this tremendous honor.  And to everyone at Focus Features, in particular David Linde, James Schamus, thank you for your love and support. To Bill Pohlad, Tory Metzger, Ira Schreck, Joe Dapello, many thanks.  And a special thanks to David Lee.  And thanks to my wife Jane Lin and my boys Han and Mason.  I love you.

In the late sixties, when Ethan was eleven or twelve, he got a suit and a briefcase and we went to the Minneapolis International Airport with a Super-8 camera and made a movie about shuttle diplomacy called ""Henry Kissinger: Man on the Go.""  And honestly, what we do now doesn't feel that much different from what we were doing then.  There are too many people to thank for this.

You have been so generous to us this evening and I wanted to thank you for that and also for an extraordinary, what a beautiful show you've done.

Peter, wherever you are, thank you so much for bringing all our cast and crew here, or as many of them as we could do.  The film is an absolute tribute to them. There's one guy I should mention.  We've mentioned a lot of people, I forgot a guy, the guy who choreographed the dance at the end of the film.  He's called Longiness, and I forgot him off the credits.  And I only found out about it two weeks ago.  I'm an idiot and I apologize from the bottom of my heart, Longiness.  Thank you so much.Finally, just to say to Mumbai: Unending, inseparable, unborn.

 Directing, The Hurt Locker,"This really is, um, there's no other way to describe it, it's the moment of a lifetime.  First of all, this is so extraordinary to be in the company of such powerful, my fellow nominees, such powerful filmmakers who have inspired me and I have admired for, some of whom, for decades.  And thank you to every member of the Academy.  This is, again, the moment of a lifetime.I would not be standing here if it wasn't for Mark Boal, who risked his life for the words on the page and wrote such a courageous screenplay.  That I was fortunate enough to have an extraordinary cast bring that screenplay to life in Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty.  And, I think the secret to directing is collaborating and I had truly an extraordinary group of collaborators in my crew:  Barry Ackroyd, and Kalle Júlíusson, and Bob Murawski, Chris Innis, Ray Beckett, Richard Stutsman.  And if I could just also thank my producing partners in Greg Shapiro and Nick Chartier, and my wonderful agent Brian Siberell.  And the people of Jordan, who were such a... so hospitable to us when we were shooting.And I'd just like to dedicate this to the women and men in the military who risk their lives on a daily basis in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world.

Thank you to all my cast; to my wonderful crew; to my producers, Iain, Gareth, Emile; to David Seidler, whose extraordinary journey from childhood stammerer to the stage of the Kodak I find so profoundly moving.But most of all, thank you to my parents, my mum and dad who are in the audience tonight.  And I know there's been a lot of thanking of mums, but this is slightly different because my mum in 2007 was invited by some Australian friends—she's Australian—in London to a fringe theater play reading of an unproduced, unrehearsed play called ""The King's Speech.""  Now she's never been invited to a play reading in her entire life before.  She almost didn't go because it didn't sound exactly promising, but thank god she did because she came home, rang me up and said, ""Tom, I think I found your next film.""

 Directing, Gravity,"Wow, thank you. Thanks to the Academy. Like any other human endeavor making a film can be a transformative experience. And I want to thank ""Gravity,"" because for many of us involved in this film it was definitely a transformative experience. And it's good because it took so long that if not it would be like a waste of time. And why it really sucks is that while for a lot of these people that transformation was wisdom, for me it was just the color of my hair.I want to share this with all these wise people who made this movie happen. My amazing son and co-writer, Jonás Cuarón. Sandra Bullock, Sandy, you're ""Gravity."" You are the soul, the heart, of the film.

But today, tonight, I am wearing the real Michael Keaton tighty whities. Thank you. They are tight, smell like balls, but it work. I'm here. Thank you, Michael.Honestly, this is crazy in a way, talking about that little prick called ego. Ego loves competition, right? Because for someone to win, someone has to lose. But the paradox is that, you know, true art, true individual expression, as all the work of these incredible fellow filmmakers, can't be compared, can't be labeled, can't be defeat because they exist and our work only will be judged, as always, by time. So, I am, you know, I [am] very thankful, grateful, humbly honored by the Academy which I thank for this incredible recognition. Which I have it here [the Oscar] because the work of all the actors, all the producers. Chivo Lubezki – which I didn't mention – Chivo, I love you. You are the genius.

And in the last twenty-five years, I've been living in a country all of our own: part of it is here, part of it is in Europe, part of it is everywhere. Because I think that the greatest thing our art does and our industry does is to erase the lines in the sand. We should continue doing that when the world tells us to make them deeper.The place I like to live the most is at Fox Searchlight, because in 2014 they came to listen to a mad pitch with some drawings and the story and a maquette. And they believed that a fairy tale about an amphibian god and mute woman done in the style of Douglas Sirk, and a musical, and a thriller was a sure bet. I wanna thank the people that have come with me all the way: Kimmy, Robert, Gary, Wayne and George, and my kids. And I wanna say like Jimmy Cagney said once: My mother thanks you.

That's something everyone facing AIDS not only needs, but deserves.  There's an inscription at Howard's grave in Baltimore.  It reads, ""O, that he had one more song to sing.""

Neil [Young], I gotta share this with you.You do your best work and you hope that it pulls out the best in your audience and some piece of it spills over into the real world and into people's everyday lives, and it takes the edge off of fear and allows us to recognize each other through our veil of differences.  I always thought that was one of the things popular art was supposed to be about, along with the merchandising and all the other stuff.

At the Academy, at the lunch they have for the nominees, where they have like a Randy Newman chicken by this time, the, Mr. Mischer said that it's not really good television to take a list out of your pocket and thank a lot of people.

I just have to thank these people.  I don't want to; I want to be good television so badly, as you can see.  I've been on this show any number of times and I've slowed it down almost every time.

 Music (Original Song), Selma,"First, I would like to thank God that lives in us all. Recently John and I got to go to Selma and perform ""Glory"" on the same bridge that Dr. King and the people of the civil rights movement marched on fifty years ago. This bridge was once a landmark of a divided nation but now is a symbol for change. The spirit of this bridge transcends race, gender, religion, sexual orientation and social status. The spirit of this bridge connects the kid from the South Side of Chicago dreaming of a better life, to those in France standing up for their freedom of expression, to the people in Hong Kong protesting for democracy. This bridge was built on hope, welded with compassion and elevated by love for all human beings.JOHN STEPHENS (John Legend):Thank you. Nina Simone said it's an artist's duty to reflect the times in which we live. We wrote this song for a film that was based on events that were fifty years ago, but we say that Selma is now because the struggle for justice is right now. We know that the Voting Rights Act that they fought for fifty years ago is being compromised right now in this country today. We know that right now the struggle for freedom and justice is real. We live in the most incarcerated country in the world. There are more black men under correctional control today than were under slavery in 1850. When people are marching with our song, we want to tell you we are with you, we see you, we love you, and march on. God bless you.LONNIE LYNN (Common):Thank you, Ava. Thank you, Ava.
